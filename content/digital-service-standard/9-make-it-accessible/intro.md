## [3]Why it's in the Standard

You need to make sure everyone who needs your service can use it. This includes people with disability and older people, and people who canâ€™t use, or struggle with, digital services.

Your service must be accessible to users regardless of their digital confidence and access to a digital environment. This includes users in remote areas and users with different devices.

You also have a legal requirement to ensure your service is usable and accessible to people with disabilities (see the [Disability Discrimination Act 1992](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/dda-guide-whats-it-all-about)). Australian Government agencies are required to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA, which includes Level A (see mandate in  [Web Accessibility National Transition Strategy](https://www.finance.gov.au/archive/publications/wcag-2-implementation/)). You are strongly encouraged to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA which will provide a more accessible experience. Conforming to WCAG 2.1 means you also conform with 2.0.
