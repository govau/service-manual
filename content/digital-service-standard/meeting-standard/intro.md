## [2]How services are assessed

All services within the scope of the [Digital Service Standard](https://service-manual.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/digital-service-standard/scope-standard/) (the Standard) are assessed against the Standard.

Assessing against the Standard ensures that we build high-quality government services that meet user needs.
