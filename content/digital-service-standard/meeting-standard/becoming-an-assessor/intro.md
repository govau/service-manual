All services that fall under the [scope of the Standard](/digital-service-standard/scope-standard/) must be assessed by a team of assessors.

Assessors help services to [meet the Standard](/digital-service-standard/meeting-standard/) and provide assurance that the criteria have been met.

To become an assessor, you will need to:

1. Be currently working in product management, delivery or agile, technical development, user research, service design or a related digital role

2. Be nominated by the team responsible for digital transformation in your agency, usually a digital transformation coordinator or team

3. Attend an [Assessing against the Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/training/) course

After completing training you will arrange with your agency to:

1. Shadow an assessment

2. Assess a service as part of an assessment team

3. Contribute to the assessment report that is [published on the DTA’s website](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/assessments/).

After your first assessment report is published, you will be recognised as an accredited assessor.

For further information please contact your agency’s Digital Transformation Coordinator or Digital Service Standard team.

If you have any questions about this process please contact DTA at <standard@digital.gov.au>
