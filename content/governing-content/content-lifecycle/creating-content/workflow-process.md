Set expectations for quality content with your authors. Let them know that quality assurance checks and usability testing are part of the content creation process.

Promote the use of the [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/) to learn how to structure content, write in plain English and create accessible content.

You will often need to convince subject matter experts of the value of user-centred content. Use your communications and engagement skills to influence and help authors understand how to do this.

Use your [content planning session](../planning-content/content-planning-workshop) to help your broader team know what you expect to achieve for the business and the user.
