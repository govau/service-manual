Experts should use the content production template (first used in the planning and creating stages) to check off quality or make comments to revise.

These checks may be all the approval you need for the content to be uploaded live to the platform. This will depend on the type of content and the authority of your web team.

Alternatively if the content is high profile it will need more senior clearance. Send a sign-off brief once checks have been done. The brief should itemise these previous checks for approver visibility (see the next lifecycle stage).
