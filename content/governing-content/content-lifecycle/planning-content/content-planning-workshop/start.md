section: Start with a user focus
---
Bring your team together to create an overarching user need. You can do this by creating a user story. Doing this at the start will give the team a focus for the workshop. It puts the user at the centre of what you are planning.

At the end of the workshop complete the acceptance criteria.

For example:

### [2]User story

As a [who the user is] I need [something] so that I can [do something].

### [2]Acceptance criteria

We will know it is done when the user:
- understands [what they need to do]
- can use and complete [a task]
- can understand how to [do something]
