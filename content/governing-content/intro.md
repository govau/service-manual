## [3]Why you should govern content
When you govern content, you bring together the right people and expertise and assign accountability and ownership.

Use content governance to:
- clarify who does what, when, how, why and where
- deliver on the goals of your content strategy
- meet government requirements for content
- apply standards and checks to ensure quality
- continuously maintain and improve content
