Content Design in Australian Government is a community of practice for people working in government content â€” including content editing, content design, content strategy, communications, marketing, publishing, user experience, accessibility and more.


The group shares experiences, ideas and learnings so that we can all help to deliver better public services for Australians. It is open to anyone working in government who can provide a government email.
