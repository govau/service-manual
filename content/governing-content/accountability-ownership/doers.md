### [2]Subject matter experts / content leads / web writing experts

The doers understand the [stages of the content lifecycle](/governing-content/content-lifecycle/). They work together to source, create, check and publish quality content.

The subject matter expert or a web writing expert may source and write individually, or share the writing. If pair writing, they will need to clarify and balance both business and user needs.

The doers must comply with endorsed guides and standards during this process. If they are unable to agree on the quality of content, the doers can ask the senior content lead to decide.

Accountability and ownership:
- know the intended lifespan of the content
- understand how the content fits in the information architecture (IA)
- know what related content is needed
- balance business and user needs
- question the quality of content
- direct the user through the content
- ensure readability and accessibility
