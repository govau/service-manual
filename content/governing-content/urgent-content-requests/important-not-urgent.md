When important content has a deadline that is not necessarily fixed, both content managers and requesters need to:
- negotiate an appropriate deadline
- prioritise the work
- allocate appropriate resources

Let requesters know why you need notice of timeframes for announcements or initiatives. Help them understand your process.

### [2]Senior communications / content lead / publisher questions
- Does there need to be a related news story, blog or social media strategy?
- Does this content already exist, on this website or another channel?
- Does the content impact existing content that will need to be updated or removed?
- Do you have inaccessible PDFs? If so, make them accessible and provide an extract and contact details.
- For high profile content that is of poor quality, discuss a way to resolve before publishing.
