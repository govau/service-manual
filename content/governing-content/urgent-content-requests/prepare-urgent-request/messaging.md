Be in touch with content creators to let them know you can help with messaging. Use a templated process to discover the who, what and why.

Offer communications skills and advice to help them craft their messaging. For example, to help them understand:
- the problem they need to solve
- why they need the content: who itâ€™s for, and - who they may need to consult
- what needs to go where on the web
- other possible content types, like a news story, blog or social media post
