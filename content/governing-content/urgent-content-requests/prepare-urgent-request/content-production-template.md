Publish content templates on your intranet for different content types. A template will give context for authors and reviewers. It also guides those not experienced in web writing.

Include fields for:
- the publishing date
- the location on the website
- user need or key message
- related links to policies and other content
- contact details (and an abstract if needed to go with accessible downloads)
- a [readability rating](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/writing-style/#readability) check. Recommend SAS Writing Reviser, a free add-on for Microsoft Word. The tool highlights passive tense as you write.
- image alt text
- reviewers to use when checking for accuracy and quality
- video accessibility checks: i.e. closed captions, transcript and audio transcript. Add phone numbers of transcription services.

See example [content production template](/governing-content/content-lifecycle/content-production-template/).
