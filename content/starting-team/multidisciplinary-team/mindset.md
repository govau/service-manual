People in a multidisciplinary team need the right mindset as well as skills.

Team members should be open to new ways of thinking and doing things. They should:
- regularly share their knowledge
- have a flexible outlook — so they can adapt their work in response to user testing
- equally value all team members’ contributions — regardless of their seniority in the organisation
- willingness to fail fast and learn quickly
- open mindset and a willingness to learn
