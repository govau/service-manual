Traditionally government has formed teams around agency structures that typically work in a linear way. Multiple teams ‘own’ different parts of the product. Specialists don’t get the chance to work together to come up with creatives solutions.

Multidisciplinary teams change this by forming teams around a problem or a service. The team starts with all the right skills to create incremental bits of value that meet a user need. They have the correct capability and skills to be autonomous and minimise dependencies.

Teams are small (less than 10). They are co-located and empowered to make decisions and to iterate rapidly.
