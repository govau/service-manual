When you build services as a multidisciplinary team, the end users and other stakeholders have a voice from the start. All of the people who have an interest in the service are together to collaborate from the beginning.

The benefits of multidisciplinary teams are that:
- roles that were traditionally inserted at the end of a project (and often too late to do their best work) can have input from the beginning
- people with complementary skills work together at the same time on the same part of the service
- the team is always jointly responsible for delivery

A multidisciplinary team uses in-depth user research when they start to make decisions about what to build and how to deliver it. This means services are:
- built using user-centred design — developed iteratively and closely with users
- guided by data and testing — they reflects the actual user journey
- focused on the end-to-end experience — they are simpler, clearer and faster
