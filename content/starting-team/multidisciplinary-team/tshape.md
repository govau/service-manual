Look for team members with ‘T-shaped’ skills. These are people who have deep knowledge in a discipline (the vertical part of the T) and the ability to work with people in other roles (the horizontal part of the T).

People with T-shaped skills are natural collaborators. They apply their deep knowledge to other disciplines to make creative connections. They are driven by curiosity to learn from other experts both in the team and elsewhere in the organisation.

‘When we have a team with T-shaped skills, we are able to keep building. I’ve worked in teams when we regularly got blocked because people couldn’t understand what each other’s work was about. They’d just work in silos, and no one could learn from each other.’ — Developer
