A team building a government service needs to have people with the following roles, either in the team or available to it:

-  service manager
-  product manager
-  delivery manager
-  user researcher
-  designers (content designer, service designer and interaction designer)
-  developer

You may not need all roles in all stages of the [service design and delivery process](../../service-design-delivery-process/). Sometimes you may need additional support in some stages of the process (for example, you may bring in subject matter experts in Alpha stage).
