-  work closely with the product manager and designers to ensure prioritisation of the work to meet the needs of the users
-  are responsible for building understanding of the users and their behaviour, and providing insight to the team about how users interact with products and services
-  take the lead on running sessions with real users, and communicating findings back to the whole team, creating actionable insights to guide work

#### Designers
Designers help your team create user-focused services and a consistent user experience.

Depending on the type of service you’re building, you may need a team of designers with a range of different skills (for example, in interaction or user experience design).

#### Service designer
The service designer works from the user research to identify how a service could be delivered so that it better meets user needs. They:

-  design user-focused services that meet web standards for all users, channels and touchpoints
-  create a blueprint or map of the proposed service to make sure the main parts are built in from the start
-  help the team in the development and continual iteration of services, making sure that there are consistent user experiences

#### Content designer
The content designer makes sure that the content in the service meets user needs. They are focused on written content, but also work on the visual and interactive parts of products. They:

-  develop content plans and strategies based on user needs
-  write clear, usable content in plain English
-  review content to make sure it’s accurate, relevant and written in line with the [GOV.AU Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/)
-  communicate the principles of content design to the service team and others across your organisation
-  advocate for users of the service by challenging requests that don’t support their needs

#### Interaction designer
The interaction designer is responsible for designing a user-focused and accessible service, and making use of established design patterns. They:

-  create the user interface for the service, ensuring that it is designed to work across devices and browsers
-  make sure the interface meets web standards, is accessible and able to be used by people regardless of their digital literacy
-  make use of agreed design patterns and contribute to the design community to improve and add to design patterns
- either make prototypes in HTML or have enough familiarity with code to work closely with developers to make the HTML prototypes

Interaction designers work closely with other members of the team:
 - content designer — to improve the usability of the service
 -  user researcher — to conduct usability testing and design experiments
 -  technical team members — to develop and iterate prototypes to help improve the service

#### Developer
The developer designs quality well-tested software and sites according to standards and best practice. They:

-  build software with a focus on what users need from your service and how they’ll use it
-  write quality well-tested code and try to find the simplest solution to a given problem
-  keep security, accessibility and open standards in mind
-  improve (refactor) the technical implementation as they go along
-  solve technical problems

Your team might have a mixture of developers that specialise in being front-end or back-end developers, but most will have solid skills in both areas.

Some developers may need mentoring in user-centred design. If you involve them from the Discovery stage, it will help them to build empathy with users. They’ll also gain experience in user research and bring their expertise to the insights gained.

Sometimes the team will need a technical lead to make it easier to prioritise work. This person is still part of the team and collaborates with everyone to make decisions.
