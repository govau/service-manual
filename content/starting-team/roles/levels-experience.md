quote: Multidisciplinary teams are a great way for people to increase their skills.

It’s important that each team member is a practitioner in their role (for example, interaction design or user research). They should also have some knowledge about other related roles.

People who have both expertise in their role and the ability to collaborate across others are said to have [T-shaped skills](../multidisciplinary-team/#get-the-right-mindset-and-skills).

It’s fine if a team member is still building experience in their role, but they do need a depth of knowledge about the area in which they’re working. A person with generalist skills usually won’t be able to deliver what the team needs.

It can help to pair up people in the same role, so the person with more experience can mentor the other.

Two traits that help people succeed on multidisciplinary teams are openness to trying new things and willingness to ask for help.
