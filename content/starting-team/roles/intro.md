subtitle: To build and maintain a user-centred service, you need team members with a range of skills and who are open to collaborating.

To build the right thing in the best way, the service team must include specialists in specific  roles. As a team they bring capabilities in research, design and delivery. This is called a [multidisciplinary team](../multidisciplinary-team/).

You may need to include other roles, skills or capability depending on the size of the service and where it is the [service design and delivery process](../../service-design-delivery-process/). Itâ€™s ideal to have the same people in the same roles through the whole process, but the team needs to be flexible and adjust to fit the work.


If you are responsible for recruiting for a team you should understand:
-  what each role does
-  the concept of a [multidisciplinary team and T-shaped skills](../multidisciplinary-team/)
-  how to build team culture
