Some of the people in a multidisciplinary team will focus more on managing the teamâ€™s activities (for example, the product manager and delivery manager). These people are still part of the team and work with the others to work out the right thing for the team to do next.

Your whole team, and in particular your designers, user researchers, content designers and developers, must work together to design, build and iterate a service based on the [user needs](../../user-research/identifying-users-needs/) of the people your service is aimed at.

Everyone who is in your team should be open to collaborating and understand what a [multidisciplinary team](../multidisciplinary-team) looks like.
