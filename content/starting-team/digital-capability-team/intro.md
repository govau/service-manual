subtitle: The team needs to have a high level of digital capability to build services that meet the needs of users.

A team with high digital capability can move quickly towards a minimum viable product (MVP). This means they can work faster with lower budgets to build services that are simple, clear and fast.

Every service a team works on together will increase the teamâ€™s digital capability. It will also increase the ability of each person in the team to work together.

Where possible, the team should be consistent from Discovery through to when the service goes live, and beyond.
