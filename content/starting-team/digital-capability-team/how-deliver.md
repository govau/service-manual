Often teams will have people of different levels of experience, but their individual experience is not a clear measure of the team’s digital capability.

A team of people who have low levels of experience may have high digital capability because they are:

-  passionate about meeting user needs
-  led by a very experienced product manager
-  open to collaborating
-  keen to work as a [multidisciplinary team](../multidisciplinary-team/)
-  innovative
-  not afraid to take risks

A team of experienced people may have low digital capability because they:

-  don’t work well with each other
-  don’t focus on meeting user needs
-  work in silos
-  do things the way things have always been done
-  are risk averse
