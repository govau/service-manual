A service is something that helps someone do something: like being able to drive, buy a house, or become a teacher.

Services are a group of transactions, activities or information that share a user need. They might take place online or offline.

The user might need to deal with different government parts of government or third-party suppliers to use the service to get what they need done.

Government services are different from commercial services because often the user doesn’t have a choice of how to use the service. The user has to go through the service in the way that government designs it, and often this design is not simple or easy to follow.

### [2]Services use products

A service may need smaller products to meet user needs. For example, being able to drive might involve these products:
information on what you need to learn to drive — an information product
- an online driving knowledge test — a web application product
- booking a driving test — a calendar booking product
- getting a driving license — a card-creating product
- paying your annual fee — an online payment product

If these products are owned by different parts of government that are working in different ways it can make it harder for the user to do what they need to do.

This is why we need service managers that own the whole experience.
