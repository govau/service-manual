A user journey is the series of processes and touchpoints that the user needs to go through to complete the service. Different users could go through similar user journeys but may have completely different user experiences.

For example, a user who doesnâ€™t have a stable internet connection may have a bad user experience when they try to complete the service. Another user may go through a similar journey with a good connection and have a good user experience.

Owning the whole user experience means that you try to create a good experience for all users and all journeys.
