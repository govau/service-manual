Every service needs a single [service manager](#) that owns the whole experience for the user.

The service manager makes sure each product works together to give the user a consistent experience.

Service managers are experienced leaders with a strong understanding of their service and its users. They:
- represent their service at all levels in agencies
- work to ensure the service is delivered successfully and meets its usersâ€™ needs
- have the decision-making authority to deliver on all aspects of a service
