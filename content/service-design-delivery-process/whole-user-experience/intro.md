subtitle: A service may have multiple products built by different teams — you need a service manager who understands and owns the whole user experience.

We know that [people struggle to get things done with government](https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/gov-au-is-a-mental-model-for-government/) because services are fragmented. We force people to learn how government is structured to do what they need to do.

We need to understand the current user experience and where it includes different products that may be owned by other parts of government.

This means we need to across government to do the hard work to make it simple for users. We’re [legislatively bound to do work together](http://www.finance.gov.au/resource-management/pgpa-act/) to build better services for people.

To build the right thing we need a senior service manager who can take responsibility for the whole user experience.
