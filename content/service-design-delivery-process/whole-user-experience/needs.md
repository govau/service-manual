To build services that are complete and reflect the whole user experience we need to [start with needs: user needs, not government needs](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/design-principles/#start-with-needs-user-needs-not-government-needs).

Owning the whole user experience means a service:
- reflects how users think about the service, what they want to do and is built on users’ needs
- has a beginning, middle and end that reflects how the needs of users change (for example finding out if you’re eligible to become a teacher is different to gathering documents so you can apply)
- can be completed as needed — by phone, online and on paper
- is accessible to everyone (for example anyone who’s in a wheelchair, blind, deaf, autistic, dyslexic or having memory problems because of stress)
