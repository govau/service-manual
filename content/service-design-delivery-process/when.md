The service design and delivery process is there to guide you from [finding out who the users are and their needs](/user-research/identifying-users-needs/) all the way through to improving the live service.

The 4 stages build on top of each other, but it’s not a one-way process. A service may get to Beta stage and then go back to Discovery to address a different need.

You don’t need a brand new service to start using the process. You can begin Discovery stage with a live service to find out if it’s actually delivering what its users need and then start making it better.
