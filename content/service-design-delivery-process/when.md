Use the service design and delivery process when you are creating or improving a service. You don’t need to be building a new service to use the process. You can start Discovery stage with a live service to find out if it’s actually delivering what users need.

The service design and delivery process is there to guide you from [finding out who the users are and their needs](/user-research/identifying-users-needs/) all the way through to improving the live service.

The 4 stages build on each other, but it’s not a one-way process. A service may get to Beta stage and then go back to Discovery to meet a different need.
