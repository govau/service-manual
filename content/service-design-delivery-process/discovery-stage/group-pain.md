You will know you are ready to move to the next step when you stop hearing new problems from users.

It will take at least 2 to 3 rounds of user research to start to find patterns in what youâ€™ve discovered. This will mark the halfway point of your Discovery stage.

Use [affinity mapping](/user-research/analysing-user-research/#affinity-mapping) to process all of your research and create groups of pain points.

There may be kinds of pain points that only a small number of people experience. These are important, but you want to look for the big problems that most people are facing. Find what will add the most value.
