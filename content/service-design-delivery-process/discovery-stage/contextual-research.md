The [team will do research with users](/user-research/research-stages/#user-research-in-discovery-stage) to get a deep understanding of the problems that the service aims to solve. They do this by finding out:
- who the users are and what they are really trying to do when they  use the service and its products (for example, planning to travel, not just applying for a passport)
- what the current experience is for users and what products they use
- what the specific user needs are for the service

You will discover [all kinds of user needs](https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/24/gov-uk-verify-how-we-talk-about-user-needs/), including:
- stated needs — the things that users explicitly tell you that they need (for example, they may need your service to be mobile responsive)
- unstated needs — the things that users take for granted that your service will have (for example, they may need information that’s easy to understand)
- created needs — the things that users are forced to do because of policy and the way government works (for example, they may have to use different online accounts for different stages of the same service)

The research you do in Discovery should include all users:
- end users, including professional ones (for example, businesses and intermediaries)
- public servants supporting service delivery and policy users — even if you are only planning to focus on a small part of that experience

You will also need to understand:
- existing business processes associated with the service, by using business process mapping
- technology that supports business processes
- how data flows through the service
- the government’s policy intent for the service, so that you are able to align this with user needs
- any obvious technical, legislative or other constraints relating to the service

The team will keep doing user research through the whole process, including after the service goes live.
