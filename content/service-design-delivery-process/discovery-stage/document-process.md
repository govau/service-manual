At the end of Discovery, itâ€™s good idea to produce a document or slide deck that you can share with your stakeholders to explain how the team reached this point. This may contain:
- hypotheses you will explore in Alpha stage
- who you talked to and the pain points you heard
- the user journey map as you understand it at that point
- any pain points that are out of scope for Alpha stage
- justification of how you made decisions and the method you used
- current benchmarks of service performance
- how you will measure improvements to the service
- photos and feedback quotes

You should also have started a decision register. You will keep using this in Alpha stage and beyond.
