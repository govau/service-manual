You should move on to the Alpha stage if:
- you've stopped hearing about new needs and you’ve formed hypotheses about the most important of those needs that you can test in Alpha
- you’re confident that you will be able to build something that adds value
- you are working on needs that only government can meet
- you won’t duplicate other government services or products
- you have support from senior stakeholders and they understand your plans
- you know how you will measure success
