Bring all the stakeholders together with the team to prioritise the pain points.

You want to agree on 1 or 2 prioritised pain points that you will explore in the second half of Discovery stage (for example, having to fill in the same information twice on different websites to apply for a passport).

Make sure you identify things the team will be able to actually deliver. There may be more than 2 that you can work on if they are not complex problems.

You can prioritise pain points with a matrix that ranks factors, such as:
- value to users
- value to government
- whether policy changes are needed
- technical feasibility
- analytics information
- level of effort for the team
- if the problem is limited to the organisation

Prioritise value to users over everything else.
