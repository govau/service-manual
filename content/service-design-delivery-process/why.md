## [3]Why should you follow the service design and delivery process?

Traditionally, government services have been focused on meeting government and policy needs first, rather than user needs. The service design and delivery process turns this around to focus on meeting user needs first — so that services deliver what users actually need.

The process helps teams to start small and learn fast, and to create services that can be delivered quickly and to save money by reducing service failure.

By working through the Discovery, Alpha, Beta and Live stages, it helps the team keep focused on making sure they are building the right thing in the right way.
