## [3]Why should you follow the service design and delivery process?
Traditionally, government services have focused on meeting government and policy needs. The service design and delivery process turns this around to focus on meeting user needs. Services designed in this way give users what they actually need.

The process helps teams to start small and learn fast, and to build services quickly. This saves money by reducing service failure.

The team works through the Discovery, Alpha, Beta and Live stages, to focus on building the right thing in the right way.
