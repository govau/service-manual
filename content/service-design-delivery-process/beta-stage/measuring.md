You need to measure and report on the performance of your service. You will have started preparing for this in the Discovery and Alpha stages.

Performance metrics are sources of information that can help you find out whether your service is meeting user needs. They make sure that the decisions you make to improve your service are based on data.

There are [4 key performance indicators for government services](/digital-service-standard/11-measure-performance/) that you must measure:
- user satisfaction
- digital take-up
- completion rate
- cost per transaction

There will be other service metrics you will want to track and report on to help you understand how well your service is meeting user needs and other goals.

You will need to:
- put the measurement plan you developed in Alpha stage into action — this means integrating your APIs, setting up your analytics and so on
- test the plan’s outcomes with stakeholders
- iterate and improve the plan

During the private beta, you will need to:
- capture real performance data for your service
- iterate and improve your service through your findings
- improve data capture methods if needed
- build your service dashboard layout
- populate your service dashboard with baseline and current data
- get internal sign-off to publish your service dashboard on the [Performance Dashboard](https://dashboard.gov.au/)

During public beta you will need to:
- publish your service dashboard on the Performance Dashboard
- plan how you will maintain your service dashboard and how you will add improvements to your metrics and data
