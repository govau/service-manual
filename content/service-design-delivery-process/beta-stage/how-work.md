In Beta stage the team should build the real thing with the minimum features that support the end-to-end user journey. Make it accessible and secure. Avoid the temptation to build a polished version of your Alpha prototype.

During Beta stage:
- make sure the team’s focus switches from experimentation to prioritising the minimum viable product
- work as a team on actual user stories — make sure you focus on needs, not wants
- define and iterate a workflow, including definition of done (DoD) and other details that help the continuous flow of backlog items

Your team should use agile delivery practices, including:
- continuous integration and delivery
- test-driven development (TDD)
- automation
- incremental design
- pair programming
