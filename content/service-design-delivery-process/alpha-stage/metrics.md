In Alpha stage you will need to decide which metrics you report on the [Performance Dashboard](http://dashboard.gov.au/). These will include the mandatory [4 key performance indicators (KPIs) for government services](/digital-service-standard/11-measure-performance/):
- completion rate
- cost per transaction
- digital take-up
- user satisfaction

To do this you should:
- have an analyst as part of your team (or available to your team) so you can start working out how youâ€™re going to measure service performance
- use your hypotheses to help you define your goals and benefits
- develop a measurement plan that starts to define what metrics your service will report on (in addition to the mandatory KPIs)
- clearly define the start and end points for your service
- engage with the Performance Dashboard team to discuss your metrics and to understand how to publish your service dashboard: [performance-dashboard@digital.gov.au](mailto:performance-dashboard@digital.gov.au)
- engage with stakeholders to raise their awareness of your measurement plan and to decide the process for signing off and publishing the metrics
