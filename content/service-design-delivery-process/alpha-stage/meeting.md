You must follow the service design and delivery process to meet [Criteria 3: Agile and user-centred process](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/3-agile-and-user-centred/) of the Digital Service Standard.

You will have to explain how you are following the service design and delivery process in your [assessment at the end of Alpha stage](#your-alpha-to-beta-assessment).

The [Digital Service Standard](/standard/) guides teams to build services that are simpler, clearer and faster.
