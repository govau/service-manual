At the end of the Alpha stage, you should have:
- user stories â€” they should relate to the overall user journey rather than being tied to individual features
- a plan for your Beta stage and a less detailed plan for your Live stage
- a decision on the metrics you will use and a measurement plan for how to capture them
- a basic working system with limited functionality that you can demonstrate to users
- an understanding of legacy systems you need to replace or integrate with
- a decision on whether to progress to Beta stage
- analysis on the user needs research you have done
- a decision on your minimum viable product
