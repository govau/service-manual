The first 3 stages of the service design and delivery process are similar to the double diamond process of discover, define, develop and deliver:

- In the first half of Discovery stage you are going wide with user research to understand the problem (discover — the first half of the first diamond).
- In the second half of Discovery you narrow in on the biggest pain points to really understand them so you can define hypotheses (Define — the second half of the first diamond).
- In Alpha stage you test your hypotheses using prototypes until you can define a minimum viable product (Develop — the first half of the second diamond).
- In Beta stage you build the minimum viable product (Deliver — the second half of the second diamond).
