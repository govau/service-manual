The service design and delivery process helps teams start delivering quickly. It also helps them to adjust their work to new information they get about your users and their needs. This reduces the risk of building the wrong thing.

Other governments, including the UK and the US, are following a similar processes to make sure they add value to their citizens. It’s also part of meeting the Digital Service Standard.

### [2]Deliver the right thing
The process focuses teams on building end-to-end services. This helps people to get things done in the way that suits them best. It also helps users with additional needs to get things done.

### [2]Deliver quickly
Frequent incremental releases increase value for users and give feedback on what needs more work. This helps the team to prioritise its resources so they keep building what users actually need.

### [2]More visibility
Regular showcases of work are build into how teams follow the process. They discover very quickly if something is not meeting user’s needs.

### [2]More adaptable
The process is iterative and transparent, with quick feedback loops. Teams learn more about user needs earlier on, and can make better decisions about how to meet them with the available resources.

The process helps teams work in progressive increments designed to meet specific needs. They can test those parts of the service and quickly adjust to iterate them.

### [2]Manage risk
The process allows teams break large risk into smaller, more manageable risks. Teams tackle the most valuable thing first.

Teams can also test assumptions, especially the risky ones, early. This allows them to make data-driven decisions based on rigorous research.

Releases become routine for the team rather than major milestones. They won’t waste time working towards a big release and find out it doesn’t help users.
