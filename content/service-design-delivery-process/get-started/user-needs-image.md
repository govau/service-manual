Traditionally, government has build services in response to policy needs. Teams would capture requirements, get the resources they need and then build and launch the thing. User needs would be discovered after the thing was built and finished.

The service design and delivery process changes this to start with user needs. The team will continue to research with users through all stages to check they are building the right thing.
