During Alpha you should be testing your prototypes with users.

As you move into Beta and then onto Live, you need to be able to show:

- the steps required to achieve an end-to-end service delivery outcome for the user
- the testing environment; using test plans, real world scenarios and user stories
- the deployment environment
- ability to create new environments quickly and easily
- that your service can perform under expected loads with suitable scale contingencies
- you understand the systems you need and the testing environments for non-digital parts of the service
- that users can seamlessly move between channels as required
- how you explored integrating automated testing into the deployment process
- you have a business continuity plan and a roll-back option.
