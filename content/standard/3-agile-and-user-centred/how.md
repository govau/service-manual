This criterion applies through all stages of the [service design and delivery process](/service-design-delivery-process/). You should:

* work in an agile way, based on [agile values and principles](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), and using agile tools and techniques
* review and iterate your processes to be able to respond to feedback, continue to improve and adapt to change
* be able to demonstrate how your team uses agile tools and techniques to communicate with each other to increase collaboration and transparency
* be able to show that your governance is appropriate to the size and scale of your service, and that it is human-centred, based on clear and measurable goals, with a clear focus on managing change and risk in real time

During the [Discovery](/service-design-delivery-process/discovery-stage/) and [Alpha](/service-design-delivery-process/alpha-stage/) stages you would have become comfortable with working collaboratively in very fast feedback loops that are guided by user research. During Alpha you should:

* test hypotheses and underlying assumptions with several prototypes
* follow a user-centred approach; include the user in all areas of the prototyping (design, iterations and so on)
* work out incrementally what is the 'right thing to build'
* determine the minimum viable product (MVP)

During the [Beta](/service-design-delivery-process/beta-stage/) and through to the [Live stage](/service-design-delivery-process/live-stage/) you would be working closely with users. You should be able to:

* show how the service has responded to user research and usability testing
* clearly describe the lifecycle of a user story, from user research to production
* explain the deployment process and how you are able to support frequent deployments with minimal impact to users.
