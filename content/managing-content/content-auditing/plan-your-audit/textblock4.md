You can dial-back the scope of the audit and strategically select areas for focus.

### [1]‘Low hanging fruit’ and quick wins

A few quick wins will help you to build momentum and motivation. For example you might focus on:
- news items you published 4 years ago that you can quickly and easily retire
- broken links you can fix
- working with content owners and approvers that you have good relationships with who will quickly give approval for content to be retired

### [1]Areas that will generate the highest impact

For example you might focus on auditing content that has:
- the highest views and poorest readability
- attracted more than a certain number of views (eg 1000 views in the last 12 months)
- been published in the last year
