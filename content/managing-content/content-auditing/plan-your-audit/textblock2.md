Using your website’s purpose as a focus, try to articulate a high-level goal for the audit. For example if you were auditing a health campaign website your goal could be to make it easier for a person to find information on a certain sport.

If the audit is being done because of external factors, some tasks will have more importance than others.

You will broadly know in advance if you want to:
- tweak the IA in response to a MoG change
- retire the site
- know what’s there to decide how much needs to be deleted or archived, updated and improved.
