Reporting on your audit can allow you to illustrate some important points around your content to get internal stakeholder support for actioning the data. For example:
- the amount of targeted content on your website
- any information architecture (IA) or navigation problems
- how much inaccurate or out of date content there is

Using this data, you can frame problems by illustrating them as percentages, for example ‘45% of our online content is inaccurate’.

Diagrams and charts can also help you to visually present the current state.
