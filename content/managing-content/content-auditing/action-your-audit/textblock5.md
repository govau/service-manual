Some content will require rework. It’s important to think about this as you’re analysing the content.

The tasks may involve:
- streamlining to make it clearer by rewriting as active tense and reducing the number of words
- rewriting to update the information to be accurate and current
- rewriting to make the content task-focused and to include a call-to-action

Add ‘rewrite’ as a task to the audit spreadsheet as you go.
