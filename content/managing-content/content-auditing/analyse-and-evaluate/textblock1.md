Work with nominated content owners or subject matter experts to review content for its accuracy, currency and any specialist meaning, policy intent and legal requirements. As you go through, ask questions such as:
- Is the content current and factually accurate?
- To remove: Is the content located elsewhere on your site or another agency’s site?
- To edit:  Is this content the main source of information? If it is a duplication of content located elsewhere on your site or another agency’s site, it should be removed.
- What content is missing?
- Are the links working and relevant?
- Are you publishing content or documents that are located on a third party owner’s website? You should link to them rather than duplicate on your site.
