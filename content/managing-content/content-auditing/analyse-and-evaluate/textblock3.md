Use data from web analytics tools to measure, rate, test and evaluate content. This can include things like page views, bounce rate, page referral, search referral, new vs return visitors, and user feedback.

Review the analytics provided by site search. If users are looking for specific content on your site and not finding it (either because it doesn’t exist or it is not findable) it may identify a content gap or a need to update how content is written or where it is published.
