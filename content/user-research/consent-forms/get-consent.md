Before you can do user research you need to get the consent of the user.

You usually do that with a conversation at the start of research in which you explain to the person you’re researching with what the research is about and what it will involve.

You usually ask the user complete a form to confirm their permission and document their preferences for how we can save and share their information, including video and audio.
