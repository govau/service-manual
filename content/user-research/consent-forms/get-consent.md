Before you can do user research you need to get the consent of the user.

You usually do that with a conversation at the start of research in which you explain to the person youâ€™re researching with what the research is about and what it will involve.

You usually ask the user complete a form to confirm their permission and document their preferences for how we can save and share their information, including video and audio.
