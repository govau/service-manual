Every user research session is different. Think about all the information you may need to capture during the research. Adjust the consent form to reflect this. For example, the participant may be sharing artefacts that contain their address and details of disability.

The most important information you need in a consent form is:
- who is conducting the research â€” the researcher, team and agency
- why you are doing the research
- what you will be recording
- what you will do with the information and recording
- how the user can withdraw their consent (including a contact phone number or email address)
- a place for the participant to sign and date
