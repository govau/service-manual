Every user research session is different. You need to think about all of the kinds of information you may need to capture during the research and adjust the consent form to include this (for example, the user may be sharing artifacts that contain their address and details of disability).


The most important information you need in a consent form is:
- who is conducting the research â€” the researcher, the team and also the agency
- why you are doing the research
- what things you will be recording
- what you will do with the information and recording
- how the user can withdraw their consent (for example, a phone number or email address)
- a place for the participant to sign and date
