You should start [interviews with users](#) by explaining the purpose of the research and showing them the consent form.

You should explain to the participant that they have a choice about what they wish to consent to, and get permission before starting any form of recording (audio, visual and written).

After the interview you should make sure the user is still comfortable with letting you use the information. Sometimes a user may say something during the interview that they donâ€™t feel comfortable sharing.

The DTA has a blog about [how to ensure informed consent in user research.](https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/informed-consent-in-user-research/)

You should leave a copy of the consent form with the participant at the end of the session so they have a record of what they have agreed to and know how they can withdraw consent if they want to later.

A good way to do this is to take a digital copy of the form and leave the original with the participant.
