User research activities produce a lot of raw data, for example:
- written and digital notes
- sketches and photos
- audio and video recordings

You need to filter, organise and interpret this data so you can produce useful and meaningful insights that will help you design and deliver your service.

Follow your [user research plan](/user-research/planning-user-research) and keep asking yourself 'What's the problem that the user is experiencing?'

Read [how user research changes](/user-research/research-stages/) through the Discovery to Live stages.
