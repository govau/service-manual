Once they’ve written down their observations, ask your team members to place their sticky notes on a wall and start sorting them into similar themes, for example:
- common topics (for example, identity, delivery, payment)
- stages in a user journey (for example, ‘provide photo’, ‘attend interview’, ‘pay’)
- individual pages or steps in a transaction
- types of user (for example, personas)

Allow people to move notes placed by other people. The idea is to look for patterns or clusters, and to keep moving the notes until clear groups emerge. This is often called ‘affinity diagramming’ or ‘affinity sorting/mapping’.

Caption: an example of an affinity mapping session in action.

‘We did affinity mapping in Alpha; other teams do it earlier in Discovery. It’s what we did after we spoke to the users. We used it to gather the user insights to find high level topics and headings. Those fed into design hypotheses. Going analogue like this gave us good visibility. It’s hands on. If we did it digitally straight away the team might not have had the level of comfort to all get involved.’

### [2]Name your groups
Once you have your groups, agree a title for each. At this stage, you can discard irrelevant or isolated notes. You should also check if you can break any large groups into smaller themes based on matching observations.

For example, if users have to provide a photo to use your service, you might have a ‘photos’  group that could broken down into:
- photo rules and requirements
- using a photo booth or department store photographer
- taking a photo at home
- reasons a photo might be rejected
