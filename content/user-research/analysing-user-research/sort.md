Once team members have written down their observations, ask them to place their sticky notes on a wall. Start sorting them into similar themes. You can group them by:
- common topics (for example, identity, delivery, payment)
- stages in a user journey (for example, ‘supply photo’, ‘attend interview’, ‘pay’)
- individual pages or steps in a transaction
- types of user (for example, first time user, business user)

Allow people to move notes placed by other people. The idea is to look for patterns or clusters, and to keep moving the notes until clear groups emerge. This is often called ‘affinity mapping’.

### [2]Name your groups
Once you have your groups, agree on a title for each. At this stage, you can discard irrelevant or isolated notes.

Check if you can break large groups into smaller themes based on matching observations. For example, if users have to supply a photo to use your service, you might have a ‘photos’  group that could broken down into:
- photo rules and requirements
- using a photo booth or department store photographer
- taking a photo at home
- reasons a photo might be rejected
