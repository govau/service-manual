After analysing your research, you should write up your findings so you can share them with the wider team and stakeholders (sometimes called a 'shareback').

You can share insights in different ways. If you've been testing prototypes you might show printouts with comments on post-its. If you've only just started you might be reading out quotes and observations.

‘A shareback wall is a way to bring back what we learnt from user research to the team. We can use it to quickly identify what’s working (green) and where there’s problems we still need to solve (in red and orange).’ — User researcher
