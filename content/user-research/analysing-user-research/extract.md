Follow these steps to gather observations:
1. Hand out sticky notes.
2. Ask team members to review the notes they took during the research. They can then write interesting or relevant observations on the sticky notes. You can use the colour of sticky notes strategically (for example, red to note pain points, green for notes about what works well).
3. If you have recordings, you can make them available. Team members can use them to confirm their observations and get verbatim quotes.
4. Tell the group to use a single sticky note for each observation and write exactly what they saw or heard (for example, quotes or observed behaviour), not what they think it means. This way, the notes will be unbiased and represent the voice of the user.

### [2]Capturing observations during research sessions

If your team is experienced and youâ€™re doing research in a lab, they may be able to capture their observations on sticky notes during the session itself.

If you go into a session wanting to capture 1 main thing, you might be able to capture that straight onto sticky notes during the research session. For example, if you only want verbatim statements, you can capture these straight onto sticky notes during the sessions.
