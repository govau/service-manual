Follow these steps to gather observations:
1. Hand out sticky notes (use just one colour).
2. Ask people to review their notes and write down anything interesting or relevant that they saw or heard during the session.
3. If you have recordings, make them available so people can confirm their observations and get verbatim quotes.
4. Tell the group to use a single note for each observation and write exactly what they saw or heard (for example, quotes or observed behaviour), not what they think it means. This way, the notes will be unbiased and can represent the voice of the user.

### [2]Capturing observations during research sessions

If your team is experienced and you’re doing research in a lab, they may be able to capture their observations on sticky notes during the session itself.

This only works for lab-based sessions because it’s difficult with most research methods to know which observations are important until you’ve reviewed all the data.
