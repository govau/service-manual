The final part of analysis involves reviewing the notes in each group to determine what the observations are telling you.

When you agree on what you’ve learned, write it as a finding or ‘insight’ on a different coloured sticky note and add it to the relevant group on your affinity map.

Write findings as short statements that summarise what you’ve learned, for example:
- ‘The legal declaration is threatening and difficult to understand.’
- ‘People think they can click the progress bar to navigate.’
- ‘Users are confused about what’s required because so many questions are optional.’
