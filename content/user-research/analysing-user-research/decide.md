You can use your findings to make decisions about what to work on, change or research next. This supports the agile method of continuous planning with new facts or requirements.

As a group, discuss if there are any actions you want to take. Write these on sticky notes in another colour. Add them to the relevant group on your affinity map. Actions might include:
- new design ideas to work on
- new questions to include in user research
- things you want to change in a prototype and test in another research session
- new user stories to add to the product backlog
- new details you need to add to an existing story
- strategic insights you can use to develop your user needs, proposition or product roadmap
