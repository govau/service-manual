Invite anyone who observed the user research to take part in the analysis session. You should do analysis as soon as you can after each round of research, while it is still fresh in people’s minds.

Involving lots of people helps your team make better decisions. It reduces the risk of researcher bias and limits the influence of individual team members or stakeholders. It also means everyone has a chance to be part of the decision of what you should work on next.

Aim to spend up to 1 hour analysing every 2 hours of research.
