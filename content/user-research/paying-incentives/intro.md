Paying incentives to participants is acceptable in many types of research. It reflects your appreciation for the participants’ input to the service.

You can thank people for their time in many ways. In some types of research, paying incentives isn’t appropriate.

If you do decide to pay incentives, factor them into your [research proposal and budget](/user-research/planning-user-research/).
