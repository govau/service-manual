Involving team members in research helps them to develop empathy for users. For this reason, we recommend doing research yourself rather than outsourcing it. Ideally, involve each of your team members for at least 2 hours every 6 weeks.

This research can be any activity in which they observe and listen to users, including:

- interviews
- home or workplace visits
- lab-based usability tests
