It can be difficult to find time to fit in exposure hours. Also, it's not always possible to get out in the field to watch people interact with a service on site.

To make sure team members get all of their exposure hours, some people include it as part of their performance management so they can make time for it and measure it.

Usability testing in a lab often provides a great opportunity for people to watch users in action.

You may need to live stream video of research sessions if you think team members might feel confronted by user feedback. But at some point, team members should observe users in person.
