It can be difficult to find time for research. Also, it's not always possible to get out in the field.

Some teams include research as part of their performance management so they can make time for it and measure it.

Usability testing in a lab can be a great opportunity for people to watch users in action.

You may need to live stream video of research sessions if you think team members might feel confronted by user feedback. But at some point, team members should observe users in person.
