It can be difficult to find time to fit  exposure hours in. Also, it's not always possible to get out in the field to watch people interact with a service on site.

To make sure exposure hours are something they stick to, some people include it as part of their performance management, so they can make time for it and measure it.

Lab usability testing often provides a great opportunity for people to watch users in action.

You may need to stream research sessions to help new team members get used to doing this. But it's always better that they observe users in person.
