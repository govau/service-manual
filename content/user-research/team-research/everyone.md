User experience is the responsibility of everyone on the team.


Participation in user research helps your team:
- understand what people experience when using your service
- learn the language that people use when talking about your service
- understand real user needs from the point of view of the user
- understand their contribution to improving the user experience
- develop empathy for the users of the service
- understand how users perceive technology
- learn about ways users overcome issues with the service
- communicate powerful evidence for change
- have a point of reference when making decisions

Team members who observe research can take part in analysis sessions to help agree on the findings and any resulting actions.

User researchers can also work closely with the rest of the team on design decisions and prototypes.
