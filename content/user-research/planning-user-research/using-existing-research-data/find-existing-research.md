section: Identifying existing research

Your organisation may already have research and data about users and their needs. There are many sources you can explore. These include:

### [2]Call centre data

Call centre data can provide information on your users' main frustrations. Call volumes about different issues can help you prioritise usability issues with your product or service.

### [2]Online and phone surveys

Surveys may already be set up. Use them to find user pain points and areas that need improvement.

### [2]Web analytics

Web analytics involves analysing quantitative data the behaviour of users on your website. The most common source is Google Analytics. Analytics can help you recognise usability problems and user types. Often analytics are set up but the data isn't analysed.

### [2]Search logs

Search logs have a lot of information about what users want and how they look for it. Information in search logs can provide evidence for usability problems. Logs can highlight when users are struggling with the way information is presented on your site. Looking at search terms can provide guidance on the words people actually use. Identifying these problems in the search logs can provide evidence for usability problems.

### [2]Social media

Your organisation's social media channels can help you recognise trends in users' perceptions. Your agency may also have social media monitoring set up. Reviewing this gives a broader perspective of user commentary.

### [2]Previous research reports

Many large organisations will already have conducted user research. This research can help you recognise different user groups and their needs.

### [2]Other organisational reports

Other reports your organisation creates can also provide information on users. For example, annual reports and strategy documents. These often contain information on user numbers and demographics.

### [2]Engagement teams

Many organisations have teams that directly engage with users. They are sometimes called client relationship or outreach teams. They can provide valuable insights.
