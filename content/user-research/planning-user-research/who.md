The first part of user research on a service is [identifying the users and their needs](/user-research/identifying-users-needs/).

You can learn about users by:

- reviewing existing evidence (for example, analytics, search logs, call centre data, previous research reports)
- [interviewing and observing](/user-research/interviewing-users/) actual or likely users
- talking to people inside and outside your organisation who work with actual or likely users

Treat any opinions or suggestions that don’t come from users as assumptions that have to be proven by doing research.
