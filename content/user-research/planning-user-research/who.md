The first part of user research for a service is [identifying the users and their needs](/user-research/identifying-users-needs/).

You can learn about users by:

- reviewing existing evidence (for example, analytics, search logs, call centre data, previous research reports)
- [interviewing and observing](/user-research/interviewing-users/) actual or likely users
- talking to people inside and outside your organisation who work with actual or likely users

Treat any opinions or suggestions that donâ€™t come from users as assumptions that have to be proven by doing research.
