At the beginning of each stage of the service design and delivery process, you must work as a team to:

- write your research questions (or ‘unknowns’) and group them by theme
- agree the groups of users you want to do research with
- decide how to recruit participants for each activity
- review and share the findings of any existing research
- identify any challenges or deadlines that may influence your research plan
- decide what user research activities will help you answer your questions ([18F Method Cards](https://methods.18f.gov/) have quick guides to research activities for each stage.)

You will need:
- space for a research wall
- sticky notes
- pens
- access to a printer.

Use the wall to highlight questions the team is exploring and share information about your research goals and findings.
