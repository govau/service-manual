When you plan what kind of research you want to do, choose a location that works for the participants and that kind of research.

You can run research sessions in:

- research studios or labs
- meeting rooms
- a participant’s home or workplace
- public spaces (pop-up research)
- your office (using a laptop or phone for remote research)

Include how you will get [informed consent from the participants](/user-research/consent-forms/) in your planning.
