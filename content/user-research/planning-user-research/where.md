When you plan what kind of research you want to do, choose an appropriate location.

You can run research sessions in:

- research studios or labs
- meeting rooms
- a participantâ€™s home or workplace
- your office (using a laptop or phone for remote research)
- public spaces (more information is available about this in [finding research participants](/user-research/find-user-research-participants/#finding-participants))

Remember to consider issues about [informed consent](/user-research/consent-forms/) in your plan.
