When you plan what kind of research you want to do, choose a location that works for that kind of research. You can run research sessions in:

- research studios or labs
- meeting rooms
- a participantâ€™s home or workplace
- public spaces (pop-up research)
- your office (using a laptop or phone for remote research)
