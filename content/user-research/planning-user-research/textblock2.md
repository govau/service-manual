## Find out who your users are

You can learn about users by:

- reviewing existing evidence (for example, analytics, search logs, call centre data, previous research reports)
- interviewing and observing actual or likely users
- talking to people inside and outside your organisation who work with actual or likely users

Treat any opinions or suggestions that don’t come from users as assumptions that have to be proven by doing research.

## Plan for each stage

At the beginning of each stage, you must work as a team to:

- write your research questions (or ‘unknowns’) and group them by theme
- decide what user research activities will help you answer your questions
- agree the types of users you want to do research with
- decide how to recruit participants for each activity
- review and share the findings of any existing research
- identify any challenges or deadlines that may influence your research plan
 
Make sure you have space for a research wall, along with post-its, pens and access to a printer. Use the wall to highlight questions the team is exploring and share information about your research goals and findings.
 
18F (US Government) have created user research and design Method Cards for each stage of delivering a service.

## Plan ahead

Once you’ve worked out what your high-level questions are and the activities you’ll use to research them, you need to work out:

- when activities need to happen (including any lead times for booking facilities or recruiting participants)
- how much funding is available and what you need to do to access it
- any processes you need to follow when choosing or appointing suppliers or agencies (ie departmental procurement requirements)

Start booking resources and sending briefs out to suppliers as soon as you can. Procurement can take longer than you think. Don’t wait until you know exactly what you’ll need or it may be too late to make arrangements.

## Involve your team

To help your team understand the role and influence of user research in each stage, involve them in:

- observing research activities
- helping with user research activities (for example, note taking, pairing on site visits)
- building prototypes and other materials
- analysing results

## Share your findings

Your research plan needs to fit into your team’s overall development approach.

This means you have to agree how to feed user research findings into story backlogs, prioritisation meetings, sprint planning and any other ways the team makes decisions about how to build your service.

If you don’t work this out, you may do huge amounts of research that the team can’t respond to. It’s also difficult to react to a team that’s moving ahead of you.

## Where to do user research

When you plan what kind of research you want to do, choose a location that works for that kind of research. You can run research sessions in:

- research studios or labs
- meeting rooms
- a participant’s home or workplace
- public spaces (pop-up research)
- your office (using a laptop or phone for remote research)
