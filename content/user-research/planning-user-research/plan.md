Once you’ve worked out what your high-level questions are and the activities you’ll use to research them, you need to work out:

- when activities need to happen (including any lead times for booking facilities or [recruiting participants](/user-research/find-user-research-participants/))
- how much funding is available and what you need to do to access it
- any processes you need to follow when choosing or appointing suppliers or agencies (such as departmental procurement requirements)

Start booking resources and sending briefs out to suppliers as soon as you can.

Procurement can take longer than you think. Don’t wait until you know exactly what you’ll need or it may be too late to make arrangements.

Allow the research plan to evolve in response to what you learn in each round.
