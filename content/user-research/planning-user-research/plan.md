Once you’ve decided on your research questions and methods, work out:

- your research schedule, including lead times for booking facilities or [recruiting participants](/user-research/find-user-research-participants/)
- how much funding is available and what you need to do to access it
- any procurement processes you need to follow when appointing suppliers

Start booking resources and sending out briefs to suppliers as soon procurement is finalised.

Procurement can take longer than you think. Don’t wait until you know exactly what you’ll need or it may be too late to make arrangements.

Allow the research plan to evolve in response to what you learn in each round.
