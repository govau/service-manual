At the beginning of each stage of the [service design and delivery process](#), you must work as a team to:

- write your research questions (or ‘unknowns’) and group them by theme
- decide what user research activities will help you answer your questions
- agree the types of users you want to do research with
- decide how to recruit participants for each activity
- review and share the findings of any existing research
- identify any challenges or deadlines that may influence your research plan

Make sure you have space for a research wall, along with post-its, pens and access to a printer.

Use the wall to highlight questions the team is exploring and share information about your research goals and findings.

If you need help identifying activities, [18F has quick reference guides to things you can do at each stage]((https://methods.18f.gov/).

There are [user research and design method cards] (created by 18F) that show you .
