To build a good service you need to learn about all your users, including those with access needs and any users who don’t currently use digital services.

Make sure you don’t exclude any users in the way you do research, such as how you [recruit participants](../find-user-research-participants/) or choose research locations.

### [2]Recruiting participants with access needs
You must recruit people with disability. Make sure they let you know their needs ahead of a session so you can make sure they can participate comfortably. For example, they might need to:
- bring someone with them
- use an assistive technology
- bring a guide dog
