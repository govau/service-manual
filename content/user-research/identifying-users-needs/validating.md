Good user needs should:
- sound like something a real user might say
- be based on evidence from user research, not assumptions
- focus on the userâ€™s problem rather than possible solutions (for example, needing a reminder
- rather than needing an email or letter)


As you progress through the service design and delivery stages, use what you learn to continually validate and refine your user needs.
