You can learn about users and their needs by:
- [interviewing](../interviewing-users/) and observing actual or likely users
- talking to people inside and outside your organisation who work with actual or likely users
- reviewing existing evidence (for example, analytics, search logs, call centre data and previous research reports)


Treat any opinions or suggestions that donâ€™t come from users as assumptions that have to be proven by doing research.

### [2]Keep researching through the whole process

You must keep [researching through each stage](../research-stages/) of the design and delivery process to make sure your service continues to meet user needs.
