You can learn about users and their needs by:
- [interviewing](../interviewing-users/) and observing actual or likely users
- talking to people who work with actual or likely users
- reviewing [existing evidence](/user-research/planning-user-research/using-existing-research-data)

Treat any opinions or suggestions that donâ€™t come from users as assumptions. Explore these in your research.

Keep [researching through each stage](/user-research/research-stages/) of the design and delivery process to make sure your service continues to meet user needs.
