You can learn about users and their needs by:
- [interviewing](../interviewing-users/) and observing actual or likely users
- talking to people inside and outside your organisation who work with actual or likely users
- reviewing existing evidence (for example, analytics, search logs, call centre data and previous research reports)

Treat any opinions or suggestions that don’t come from users as assumptions that have to be proven by doing research.

You must keep [researching through each stage](/user-research/research-stages/) of the design and delivery process to make sure your service continues to meet user needs.
