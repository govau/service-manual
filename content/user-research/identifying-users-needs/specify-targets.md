### [2]Specify target groups


Depending on your research objectives, your criteria might be:
- a particular demographic (for example, women under 30 years of age)
- a specific user group (for example, small business owners or job centre staff)
- specific life events (for example, users who have recently moved home or are looking for a job)
- specific access needs (for example, people who use assistive technology)
- a specific level of digital skill (for example, users who have basic online skills)


Ask subject experts for information about target groups. They may know about groups that you haven’t already included. They may also help you to get in touch with people who need extra support to take part in your research.


Review your participant criteria to make sure they are relevant to your research questions. Do a gap analysis to make sure you don’t miss important groups.


Outside of any specific criteria, always try to recruit a representative spread of:
- age
- gender
- social and economic status
- cultural and linguistic background
- education level


The research methods you use will determine the number of participants that you need. For example, you’ll need:
- 4–8 participants per round of user research
- more than 250 participants for benchmarking
