### [2]Specify target groups


Depending on your research objectives, your criteria might be:
- a particular demographic (for example, women under 30 years of age)
- a specific target user group (for example, small business owners or job centre staff)
- specific life events (for example, users who have recently moved home or looking for a job)
- specific access needs (for example, users who rely on a screen reader, magnifier, mouth stick or head wand)
- a specific level of digital skills or use of digital technology (for example, users who have basic online skills)


Ask subject matter experts for their input on target groups. They may know about groups that you haven’t already included. They can also help you to get in touch with people who need extra support to take part in your research.


Review your participant criteria with your team to make sure you’re recruiting the right range of people to answer the questions you have.


Outside of any specific criteria, always try to recruit a representative spread of:
- age
- gender
- social and economic status
- cultural and linguistic background
- education level


The research methods you use will determine the number of participants that you need. For example, you’ll need:
- 4–8 participants per round of user research
- more than 250 participants for benchmarking


Do a gap analysis to make sure you don’t miss out on important groups.
