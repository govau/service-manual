### [2]Who to include in your research
When you’re researching with users who don’t or can’t use digital services you should focus on the people who are current users of your service or who are likely to use it in future.


Research with people who have the lowest levels of digital skill, confidence and internet access. This will help you understand people whose support needs are most difficult to meet (for example, they may not be able to leave their home or have no computer).


Make sure you research with people who get digital support from third parties.


Include people who have high levels of skill in your research. They may still need help with an online service (for example, if the service is complex or they don’t trust it).


### [2]How to do your research
When carrying out your research, you should:
- specifically address users’ digital support needs across all channels (including online and offline)
- hold the research in places where users use the service (for example, if they need to go to the post office to get support, do it there)
- talk directly to users, rather than relying on the opinions of third parties
- don’t rely solely on self-assessment of digital skills — wherever possible, get them assessed by an expert user researcher
- show the on-screen service to all users, including those with low levels of digital skills and confidence, so they can give you accurate feedback on the support they would need
- find out the places where users seek support, including government contact centres, libraries, friends and family, trade bodies, paid intermediaries, charities or colleagues
