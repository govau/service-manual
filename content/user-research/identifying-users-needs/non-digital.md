### [2]Who to include in your research
When you’re researching with users who don’t or can’t use digital services you should focus on the people who are current users of your service or who are likely to use it in future.

Include people in your research who have low levels of digital skill and internet access. They will help you understand support needs that are the most difficult to meet. For example, some users may not be able to leave their homes or may not have a computer.

Include people in your research who get support to use digital services. For example, they may get help from carers or support workers.

And include people in your research who have high levels of skill. They may still need help with an online service if it is complex or they don’t trust it.

### [2]Things to remember when doing research
When carrying out your research, remember to:
- explore users’ digital support needs across all channels (including online and offline)
- hold the research in places where users use the service (for example, if they need to go to the post office to get support, do it there)
- talk to users rather than relying on the opinions of third parties
- don’t rely on self-assessment of digital skills — wherever possible, get them assessed by an expert user researcher
- show the on-screen service to all users so they can give you accurate feedback on the support they would need
- find out the places where users seek support, including government contact centres, libraries, friends and family, trade bodies, paid intermediaries, charities or colleagues
