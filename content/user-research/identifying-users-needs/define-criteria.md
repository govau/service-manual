First, define all the different types of people you need to include in your research. Use existing research, consult with subject matter experts and frontline staff, and use service data to help you do this, including:
- analytics
- general population statistics
- user groups that may have differing experiences when using your product
- user personas (if available)


You can think about who to include in specific rounds of research when youâ€™ve defined your overall criteria.
