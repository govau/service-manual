You should share your users’ needs with anyone who’s interested in your service, including colleagues, stakeholders, users and the public.


When presenting user needs, it can be helpful to group them by:
- audience, user type or persona (for example, new parent, caseworker or small business)
- stage in a process (for example, register, apply or interview)
- function (for example, identity, payments or licensing)


The more you share, the more people will learn about your users and what they need from your service. They’ll also ask questions, spot gaps and comment on what you’re doing. All of these will help you design a better service.
