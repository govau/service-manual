User needs tend to be high level, broad in scope and stable over time.


As you design your service, you’ll use them to write user stories. These describe the specific features and content you need to create for your service.


User stories are normally written in a more constrained format than user needs. They include additional information like acceptance criteria, level of complexity and dependencies. Teams use them to organise work into manageable chunks that create tangible value.


When writing a user story, you should keep track of the user needs it relates to. This allows you to track related activities and assess if you’re meeting user needs.
