Your service must be built with user-centred design that satisfies the needs of users to get the right outcome.


The current experience of a service might involve interacting with different products that may be owned by different parts of government. The service you are designing and building needs to meet the whole user experience with those products.


Make sure the whole experience is clear and simple for the user. You won’t meet the user’s needs if you only work on a product in isolation.


Services designed around users and their needs:
- are more likely to be used
- help more people get the right outcome for them — and achieve their policy intent
- cost less to operate by reducing time and money spent on resolving problems
