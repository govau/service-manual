Services designed around user needs:
- are more likely to be used
- help more people get the right outcome, achieving government's policy intent
- cost less to operate by reducing time and money spent on resolving problems

The current experience of a service might involve interacting with different products that may be owned by different parts of government. The service you are designing and building needs to meet the [whole user experience](/service-design-delivery-process/whole-user-experience/) with those products.

Make the whole experience clear and simple for the user. You wonâ€™t meet their needs if you work on a single product in isolation.
