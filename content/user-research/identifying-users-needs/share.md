Once you’ve learned about the different kinds of users of your service, present what you know in a way that’s easy for others to understand and share.


You can present what you know by creating:
- experience maps that show how users interact with existing services
- user profiles or personas that describe groups of users with similar behaviour and needs
- case studies that explore individual experiences
