Once you’ve learned about the different kinds of users of your service, present your findings. Do it in a way that’s easy for others to understand and share.


You can present your findings by creating:
- experience maps that show how users interact with existing services
- user profiles that describe groups of users with similar behaviours and needs
- case studies that explore individual experiences
