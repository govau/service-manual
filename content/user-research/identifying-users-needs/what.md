Traditionally, governments have looked at user needs from a policy perspective. From this viewpoint, they have seen them as things they can fix with technology.

Our way of working asks government to look at our services from the user’s perspective.

For example, people experience several touchpoints with government when they travel overseas. They may need to get a passport, check travel warnings or register their travel details. All these add up to an entire service from the user’s perspective.

We recognise user needs by focusing on people’s goals rather than their preferences. Goals are the things that they need to do. Preferences are things like website style or colour.

People interact with services, not websites. They use our digital services when those services are simple and fast.
