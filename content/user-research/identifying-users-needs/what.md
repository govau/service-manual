Traditionally, governments have looked at user needs from a policy perspective. From this viewpoint, they have seen them as things they can fix with technology.

Our way of working asks government to look at our services from the user’s perspective.

Who are our users? They are people who need use government services to get things done. 

For example, people experience a number of touch points with government when they travel overseas. All these add up to an entire service from the user’s perspective. They may need to get a passport, check travel warnings or register their travel details online.
Our services work when we make it easy for people to understand how we want them to do these things.

We recognise user needs by focusing on people’s goals rather than their preferences. Goals are the things that they need to do. Preferences are things like website style or colour.

People interact with services, not websites. They use our digital services when those services are simple and quick.
