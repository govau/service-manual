Once you have a good understanding of your users’ needs, you should write them down and add them to your descriptions of users.


User needs are usually written in the format:
- I need/want/expect to… (What does the user want to do?)
- So that… (Why does the user want to do this?)


If it’s helpful, you can add:
- As a… (Which type of user has this need?)
- When… (What triggers the user’s need?)
- Because… (Is the user limited by any circumstances?)


Write user needs from a personal perspective using words that users would recognise and use themselves.


Focus on what’s most important for your users so you don’t create an unmanageable list of user needs.
