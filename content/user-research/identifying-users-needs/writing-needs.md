Once you have a good understanding of your users’ needs, write them down. You can then add them to your descriptions of users.

User needs are usually written in the format:
- I need/want/expect to … (What does the user want to do?)
- So that … (Why does the user want to do this?)

You can add:
- As a … (Which type of user has this need?)
- When … (What triggers the user’s need?)
- Because … (Is the user limited by any circumstances?)

Write user needs from a personal perspective. Use words that people would recognise and use themselves. For example:

> 'As an **Australian** I need **a passport** so that **I can go overseas and prove who I am**.'

Focus on what’s most important for your users so you don’t create an unmanageable list of user needs.
