Once you have a good understanding of your users’ needs, you should write them down and add them to your descriptions of users.

User needs are usually written in the format:

- I need/want/expect to ... (what does the user wants to do?)
- So that ... (why does the user wants to do this?)


You can add:
- As a ... (Which type of user that has this need?)
- When ... (What triggers the user’s need?)
- Because (Is the the user limited by any circumstances?)


Write user needs from a personal perspective using words that users would recognise and use themselves.


Focus on what’s most important for your users so you don’t create an unmanageable list of user needs.
