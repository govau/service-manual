Groups to consider including in user research are people who:

- currently use the service
- don't currently use the service but may need it in the future
- have problems using the service
- work in the service (for example, call centre staff)
- help others use the service (for example, caseworkers, legal professionals or charity workers)

When researching, focus on users who have problems using the existing service and its products. This will help you create a simpler, clearer and faster service that more people can use.
