You must understand the needs of all kinds of people, including those who arenâ€™t currently using your service but may in the future.


You also have to consider the needs of people who provide the service or support other users (for example, caseworkers, call centre agents, inspectors, lawyers and charity workers).


When researching, focus on users who have problems using the existing service and its products. This will help you create a simpler, clearer and faster service that more people can use.
