The Service Design in Australian Government community is a place to share experiences and ask questions. It's for people who contribute to designing Australian government services, inlcuding:
* user research
* content design
* web analytics
* product management
* accessibility.

It is for all parts of government: federal, state and local.

You can [join Service Design in Australian Government](https://docs.google.com/a/digital.gov.au/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSew8K2LIZNFI8k1r9a3p6gQuIkuJ8b-7Yl99HI0W_gTZRgjkg/viewform?c=0&w=1).
