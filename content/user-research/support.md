## [3]Join the service design community
[Service Design in Australian Government](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.gov.au/forum/#!forum/service-design-in-australian-government) is a group for people who are doing design (all kinds!), user research, content design, web analytics, product management, accessibility â€” anything that is contributing to great service design for public services in Australia.

It is for all parts of government: federal, state and local. We're sharing our experiences here so that we can all help to deliver better public services for Australians.
