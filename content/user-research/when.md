You should do user research in every iteration of every development stage — starting in Discovery and continuing throughout Live.

To work in an agile way, service teams must be able to quickly:
- expand their understanding of users and their needs
- test new design ideas, content and features to see if they work well for all users
- understand problems users are having and how they might be resolved

You can’t just do user research at the beginning or end of development.

Doing this means you can:
- save time by building only the things that you know your users need
- reduce risk by learning quickly whether the things you are building work well for users
- respond to changing user behaviour and feedback to continuously improve the service
