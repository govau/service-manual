Do user research in every iteration of every development stage. Start in Discovery and continue throughout Live.

This allows you to:
- expand your understanding of users and their needs
- test new design ideas, content and features
- understand users' problems and how they might be resolved
- save time by building only the things that you know your users need
- respond to changing user behaviour and feedback by continuously improving the service
