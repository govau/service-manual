Once you’ve started the session and the participant is settled:
- get the participant’s [informed consent](#)
- run through your introduction script
- start with a few general questions to help the participant relax (for example, ask them about their journey or to tell you about their job)
- take time to adjust to their conversation pace and style

Use your discussion guide and get participants talking with open, neutral questions like:
- ‘How do you …?’
- ‘What are the different ways you …?’
- ‘What do you think about …?’

Encourage them to give more detail with simple follow-up questions like:
- ‘You said … when/why/who was that?’
- ‘Can you tell me more about …?’
- ‘In what way …?’
- ‘Could you elaborate on … to help me understand …?’

During the interview:
- focus on stories and real examples — avoid generalities and talking about how things ‘should’ happen
- make sure you really listen — show the participant you’re interested in what they’re saying
- make sure you understand what the participant has said — ask more questions if you’re not sure
- don’t change the flow of the interview abruptly — if a participant goes off topic, wait for a natural break and gently bring them back to what you want to talk about
- try to stay quiet — the more you talk, the less your participant will talk
- don’t stick to your discussion guide rigidly —  let the conversation develop naturally and be prepared to dig into any new and interesting issues that come up
- keep in mind the main questions you need to ask everyone in that round.

Once you’ve finished:
- thank the participant
- reconfirm consent
- make sure any personal information you’ve collected (on paper or in recordings) is stored safely so you can transport it securely
- pack away your equipment — use your planning checklist
