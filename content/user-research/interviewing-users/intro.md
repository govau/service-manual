subtitle: Interviews are a technique to help you learn more about users and their experience, how they use a service and what they need from it.

Use interviews when you want to:

- learn more about your users and relevant aspects of their lives and work
- get a deeper understanding of any problems that users tell you about
- explore their understanding or perspective on a topic

Interviews are an important part of the Discovery stage, but you’ll keep using them as part of your [research through the other stages](/user-research/research-stages/) of the service design and delivery process.

In Alpha and the later stages you’ll often combine interviews with usability testing.
