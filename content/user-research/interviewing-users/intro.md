Use interviews when you want to:

- learn more about your users and relevant aspects of their lives and work
- get a deeper understanding of any problems that users tell you about
- explore users' understanding or perspective on a topic

Interviews are an important research method in the Discovery stage. But you’ll keep using them through the [service design and delivery process](/service-design-delivery-process). They will help you to get in-depth information about users.

In Alpha and the later stages you’ll often combine interviews with usability testing.
