The interview will usually have a note taker, and maybe 1 or more observers. If you are not taking notes you should just watch and listen.

Take the opportunity to introduce yourself to the participant if the lead researcher doesn’t.

### [2]Focus on the participant and avoid creating distractions
Get to the session early and don’t leave the room during a session. If possible wait until the participant leaves before you do.

Be careful about using a laptop to take notes — this may be distracting and make the participant uncomfortable. You may be able to join the session via live streaming if you prefer to take notes on a laptop.

If you are using a laptop or phone to record the session make sure you turn off any notifications during the session.

Be mindful of video/audio recording and of what you say during, before and after a session.

### [2]Take selective notes
Think about the specific things that the team needs to understand.

Write down anything interesting or relevant that you see or hear during the session. Write down:
- direct quotes — use quotation marks to show that this is what they said, not your interpretation
- behaviours and patterns — write ‘appear to’ or ‘seems’ so you know this is your observation
- design problems (pain points)
- ideas and suggestions (gains)

Use a single note for each observation and write exactly what you see or hear not what you think it means. This way, the notes will be unbiased and can represent the voice of the user.

Note time stamps for anything important — this will make it easier to find this part of the recording.

If you have recordings, make them available so people can confirm their observations and get verbatim quotes.

### [2]Hold your questions until you are prompted
Don’t feel tempted to answer or correct any questions the participant asks back to the lead researcher.

Write down any questions you might have for the participant. Save them until the end of the session, unless the interviewer asks you.

### [2]Discuss the interview later
Don’t discuss the participant or details from the session outside of the research session (for example, in the bathroom or hallways). Participants could hear you.

Don’t analyse what is happening during an interview or between sessions — analysis comes later.
