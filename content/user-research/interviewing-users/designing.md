To create an interview structure:

1. review the research questions you’re trying to answer
2. think about any processes or technology you want to see (for example, existing products people are using)
3. write a list of the topics you want to cover
4. order the topics to create a logical flow

For each topic:

1. write starter questions to introduce the topic
2. add possible follow-up questions you might ask to learn more
3. test your questions and structure by interviewing a colleague — revise any questions that aren’t clear and re-order your topics if the interview doesn’t flow well

If you are doing usability testing as part of the interview, the structure will be different.

### [2]Writing interview questions
Write questions that are open and neutral.

Work on questions with your team to avoid confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is when the way a question is asked limits the participant to an answer you want or are already expecting.

Learn about confirmation bias and other [cognitive biases in user research](http://www.uxaustralia.com.au/conferences/uxaustralia-2016/presentation/6-cognitive-biases/).

### [2]Create discussion guide
Once you have questions, create a ‘discussion guide’. This should include:
- your introduction script — this tells the participant who you are, explains the research and asks them for [consent to talk to them and record](/user-research/consent-forms/)
- the interview topics — including starter and follow-up questions, and instructions for any activities
- a planning checklist to make sure you have everything you need on the day

Use the discussion guide to:
- stay on track during interviews
- make sure any other interviewers in this round of research cover the same topics — so participants have a consistent experience and you collect information that can be compared
- review interview sessions with your team
- keep a record of what you do in this round of research
