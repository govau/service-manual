You normally do in-depth interviews with 1 user at a time. You can also speak to people in pairs or small groups if they use a service together (for example, family members who help each other, or members of a team who work together on tasks).

### [2]Work out how much detail you need
Interviews can take between 30 minutes and 2 hours, depending on the complexity of the subject and number of questions you have.

Longer interviews will give you more detail but make it harder to recruit participants.

### [2]Choose a location for your research

Interviews can take place almost anywhere, including a user’s home or workplace, over the phone or at a neutral place like a research studio, café or public library.

You need to make sure the participants can easily access the location.

### [2] Recruit research participants

There are different ways to [find people to participate in user research](/user-research/find-user-research-participants/). These people should be current or likely users of the service you’re researching.

Plan for any [incentives you’ll pay to the participants](/user-research/paying-incentives/).

Make sure you arrange for interpreters or assistants to help participants that need them.

### [2]Prepare consent forms
You’ll need to make sure you have [informed consent from the participants](/user-research/consent-forms/) before you interview them.

Think about about if you need to record the session and make sure the consent forms cover this.

### [2]Prepare for observers
Invite [observers and arrange a note taker](/user-research/interviewing-users/#taking-notes-and-observing) for each session.

Observers are important for certain kinds of research, like lab-based usability testing. Sometimes you should not invite observers (beyond the note taker) in the room. Think about how their presence may affect the participants.
