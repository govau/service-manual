subtitle: The kind of research you do with users changes depending on where you are in your service delivery process.
category: User research

At the beginning of the project it is important for the team to frame the service around the needs and goals of your users. This is why the [Discovery stage](#) is important.

Once you’ve built a prototype, you need to test it with users to make sure it works.

There are different kinds of research that you do, depending on:
- where you are in the process
- maturity of the service (if it is operational)
- research questions you are trying to answer

There are 2 main types of research:
- generative — research to make sure we are designing the right thing
- evaluative — research to make sure we are designing it the right way research

Always do research with a broad range of users, including those with access needs and low digital skills.

Think about the whole service ecosystem and [whole user experience](#), not just the digital service you are delivering.
