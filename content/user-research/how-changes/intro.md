subtitle: The kind of research you do with users changes depending on where you are in your service delivery process. 
category: User research

At the beginning of the project it is important for the team to frame the service around the needs and goals of your users so you need to do discovery. Once youâ€™ve built a prototype, you need to test it with users to make sure it works.

There are different kinds of research that you do, depending on:
- where you are in the process
- the maturity of your service (if it is operational) 
- the research questions you are trying to answer. 
 
There are 2 main types of research:
- research to make sure we are designing the right thing (generative research)
- research to make sure we are designing it the right way (evaluative research).
 
Always do research with a broad range of users, including those with access needs and low digital skills. Consider the whole service ecosystem, not just the digital service you are delivering.
