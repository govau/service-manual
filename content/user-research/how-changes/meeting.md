You must do user research when designing your service as part of meeting the following criteria:
- [Criteria 1: Understand user needs](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/1-user-needs/)
- [Criteria 2: Agile and user-centred process](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/2-multidisciplinary-team/)
- [Criteria 9: Make it accessible](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/9-make-it-accessible/)
- [Criteria 10: Test the service](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/2-multidisciplinary-team/)
- [Criteria 12: Don’t forget the non-digital experience](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/12-non-digital-experience/)
- [Criteria 13: Encourage everyone to use the digital service](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/13-encourage-use-of-the-digital-service/)

You may have to explain how you did this in your service assessments.

The [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/) guides teams to build services that are simpler, clearer and faster.
