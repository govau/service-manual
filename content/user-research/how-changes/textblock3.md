There are two different research stages in beta - the process to build the beta service and the period in which you have real users of the beta service. 
 
#### Research while you build the beta service
 
You can do more of the same research as you you were doing in Alpha. The difference in beta is that you are looking to refine a solution ready for launch.

Do task based usability testing with a wide range of users. In your research you should be identifying design hypothesis and taking a structured approach to your evaluation so you can be clear about what is working well and where there remains more work to be done. 
Make sure you are doing accessibility testing with people who have access needs. You should aso commission an external review of accessibility before you put the service into real beta.
 
 
#### Research in operational beta service
 
Keep doing what you were doing before but add
- analytics (including reporting KPIs to dashboard)
- interviews / shadowing of real users
- live intercepts
- A/B or MVT (care re: sample size depending on the size of your beta)
- feedback from front line staff / ops
- face-to-face and remote usability tests to find usability and accessibility issues
- an accessibility audit to uncover accessibility issues and get recommended fixes
- private or public beta tests of the end-to-end service with real users, including support options
- web analytics and back-office data to measure service performance
using surveys or follow-up interviews to collect detailed feedback from service users
 
From these activities youâ€™ll typically learn:
- more about how different kinds of users experience your services
- the usability and accessibility issues you need to fix 
- ways to improve your service
