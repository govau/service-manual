In alpha, try lots of different approaches to meet user needs and find out which approach works best. Be prepared to throw ideas (and prototypes) away if they do not meet user needs.
 
You will know that something works best because people will be able to get from one end to the other most easily - understanding what they are doing and not making mistakes. 
 
Do task based testing so that you can clearly understand which version is most effective. We care about what works, not what people tell us they prefer.
 
Once you have a prototype (even if itâ€™s a paper one initially) you can start to test it with users. You can see whether your ideas will meet user needs and find out if it is easy to use. You can then use this insight  to iterate your design and test again with users.
 
You can combine testing your prototypes with some discovery style interviews to continue to deepen your understanding of user needs.
