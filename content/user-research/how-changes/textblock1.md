Before you start to design anything, find out about your users so that you can understand how the service you’re designing can meet their needs.  
 
To learn more about your users and their needs, you can:
- observe users, by doing contextual qualitative research, to see how they do things now and what problems or barriers they face
- interview and observe front line service staff (if your agency has them). This will help you to understand:
 - the limitations of the current service
 - how staff are explaining some of the complexities
 - the undocumented workarounds that are used to get things done
- map the user journey of people who want to do the task your service provides - do research to understand the real journey, not just the journey the business would like to think they have.
- examine existing data (for example analytics, back-office workflow and support logs). This can reveal new issues and provide quantitative evidence for qualitative insights.
- review previous user research--it is better to do this after you have conducted your own primary research to avoid bias. No matter how much research has previously been done it is important for the team to conduct their own research to help build a direct understanding and empathy for the user and their needs. 
 
From these activities you should get:
- an understanding of what problem your service is trying to solve for the user
- a list of users’ touchpoints as they try to achieve their goal. This is often expressed as a journey map, service map or mental model (alignment diagram)
- sets of needs and task models for different types of users
- key insights about users that you’ve gained from analysing the research 
- a list of research gaps or limitations of the current research and opportunities for further research
- descriptions of different types of users and the characteristics that are significant for this service. This is often expressed as user profiles or personas. In general we prefer to use profiles combined with actual stories from users the team has met. This tends to be more effective than developing personas, as empathy for an actual user is likely to be more authentic than empathy for a persona.
 
You’ll have done enough research when you understand the different kinds of people who use your service and what they need from it, including those with support and access needs.
 
Discovery research does not just happen in the discovery phase - teams need ongoing research to understand the evolving needs of their service.
