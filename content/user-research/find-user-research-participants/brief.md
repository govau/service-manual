You should do user research yourself so that you build empathy with the users. It also means you will understand the relationship between the questions that were asked and the answers that you get.

A recruitment brief is a set of instructions sent to an agency for recruiting user research participants.

The recruitment brief is then usually converted into a recruitment ‘screener’ which is used by the agency to interview potential participants and ensure you have the correct mix of people for your research.

Screeners can look complex but are very important to get right to ensure you have the right people participating in the research.

You should have a conversation with the recruiter about who will write the screener. If you have specific criteria for recruitment, you can provide questions or a full screen to be used.

### [2]What to put in a recruitment brief

In your brief, you should cover:
- research dates, including times and length of each session, the break you need between sessions, and the number of sessions you wish to do in a single day
- research location
- the number of participants you want to recruit
- a description of the types of people you want to recruit (often referred to by agencies as ‘recruitment criteria’)
- incentives (you can ask the agency to handle cash incentives)

You should make it clear that you welcome participants with access needs and low digital skills. This is important because recruiters often exclude these groups by default.

Send the agency a written brief, even if they’re happy to take instructions over the phone. This will provide a record in case there are problems with the recruitment.

### [2]Review the screener

The agency will send you a screener based on the criteria you sent them.

Always check the screener matches your needs because it’s not unusual for them to miss points you’ve included in your brief. The agency may also add standard questions that exclude participants you would like to recruit.
