You should do user research yourself so that you build empathy with the users. It also means you will understand the relationship between the questions that were asked and the answers that you get.

A recruitment brief is a set of instructions sent to an agency for recruiting user research participants.

The recruitment brief is then usually converted into a recruitment ‘screener’ which is used by the agency to interview potential participants and ensure you have the correct mix of people for your research.

Screeners can look complex, but they are very important to get right to ensure you have the right people participating in the research.

You should have a conversation with the recruiter about who will write the screener. If you have specific criteria for recruitment, you can supply questions or a full screen to be used.

### [2]What to put in a recruitment brief

In your brief, you should cover:
- research dates, including times and length of each session, the break you need between sessions, and the number of sessions you wish to do in a single day
- research location
- the number of participants you want to recruit
- a description of the types of people you want to recruit (often referred to by agencies as ‘recruitment criteria’)
- incentives (you can ask the agency to handle cash incentives)
