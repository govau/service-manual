To recruit participants you can:
- use a research recruitment agency
- work with a professional body, specialist charity or community group
- work with specialist sections of other agencies, eg Multicultural Services in DHS for CALD and Indigenous related recruitment
- create a panel of potential participants (for regular research with a specific group of people)
- invite existing users of your service to take part
 
Agencies are generally best for recruiting members of the general public. Recruiting participants requires quite a lot of work and agencies tend to be able to do this at a reasonable rate which can be good value for money. For specific user groups, a relevant professional body, charity or community group might be more effective. 
 
 
You will need to think about and budget for paying incentives to the users who participate in research. Research Recruitment Agencies can handle incentive payments for you as a part of their services.

### Researching at a venue
If you want to do pop-up research, which involves going to a specific venue and approaching people directly, you should:
- go to a place where your target users are likely to be (for example, a library, college or community group, or service centre)
- get permission to use the area
- try to get a balanced sample of participants
 
You should use this as one of a number of research methods.
