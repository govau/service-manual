There are different ways to recruit participants:
- use a research recruitment agency
- work with a professional body, specialist charity or community group
- work with specialist sections of other agencies (for example, Multicultural Services in the Department of Human Services)
- create a panel of potential participants (for regular research with a specific group of people)
- invite existing users of your service to take part

Agencies are generally best for recruiting end users. Recruiting participants requires quite a lot of work and agencies tend to be able to do this at a reasonable rate. This can be good value for money. For specific user groups, a relevant professional body, charity or community group might be more effective.

You will need to think about and budget for [paying incentives](/user-research/paying-incentives/) to the users who participate in research. Research Recruitment Agencies can handle incentive payments for you as a part of their services.
