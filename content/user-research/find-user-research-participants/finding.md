There are different ways to recruit participants:
- use a research recruitment agency
- work with a professional body, specialist charity or community group
- work with specialist sections of other agencies (for example, Multicultural Services in DHS for CALD and Indigenous related recruitment)
- create a panel of potential participants (for regular research with a specific group of people)
- invite existing users of your service to take part

Agencies are generally best for recruiting end users. Recruiting participants requires quite a lot of work and agencies tend to be able to do this at a reasonable rate which can be good value for money. For specific user groups, a relevant professional body, charity or community group might be more effective.

You will need to think about and budget for [paying incentives to the users](#) who participate in research. Research Recruitment Agencies can handle incentive payments for you as a part of their services.

### [2]Researching at a venue

If you want to do pop-up research, which involves going to a specific venue and approaching people directly, you should:
- go to a place where your target users are likely to be (for example, a library, college or community group, or service centre)
- get permission to use the area
- try to get a balanced sample of participants

Pop-up research works best when you have clear, simple objectives (for example, you want to see if people can find certain guidance or provide specific information).

**[BREAKOUT BOX]
Pop Up User Research: a specific form of user research where we go into the field and intercept people in context for short interviews or usability tests. Commonly known as ‘guerilla testing’ we call it pop up because people typically do ‘guerilla testing’ due to a lack of support in the organisation to do better quality user research. Fortunately we have user needs at the centre of our work, so we are able to use the right research at the right time.

There are limitations to doing pop-up research (for example, short sessions, random participants, recording problems) so you should always combine it with other research methods.
