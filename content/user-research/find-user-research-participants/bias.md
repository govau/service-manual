It’s hard to recruit an unbiased sample of user research participants. This is because you’re likely to include some people and exclude others depending on:
- what the activity is
- when the sessions are scheduled
- where you’re doing the research
- the method you use to recruit your users

The best way to limit this risk is to use a variety of user research activities and recruitment approaches.

If you’re using an agency, you should also make sure they don’t exclude people with low digital and literacy skills or over-recruit people with flexible work patterns.
