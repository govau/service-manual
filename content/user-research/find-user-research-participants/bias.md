It’s hard to recruit an unbiased sample of user research participants. This is because you’re likely to include some people and exclude others depending on:
- what the activity is
- when the sessions are scheduled
- where you’re doing the research
- the method you use to recruit your users

The best way to limit this risk is to use a variety of user research activities and recruitment approaches. For example, in Discovery stage don't just rely on on interviews. Do some contextual research with people who are using the service and lab research with users of existing services.

If you’re using an agency make sure they include a range of participants. For example:
- people with different levels of digital and literacy skill
- people from different cultural backgrounds
- people who have different work patterns (part time, full time, casual workers)
