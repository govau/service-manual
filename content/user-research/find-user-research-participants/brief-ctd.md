Send the agency a written brief, even if they’re happy to take instructions over the phone. This will be a record in case there are problems with the recruitment.

### [2]Review the participant screener

The recruitment brief usually forms the basis of a recruitment ‘screener’. This is used by the agency to interview potential participants. It helps them to ensure you have the correct mix of people for your research.

Screeners can look complex, but they are important to get right. Have a conversation with the agency about who will write the screener. If you have specific criteria, you can supply questions.

Always check the screener matches your needs because it’s not unusual for them to miss points you’ve included in your brief. The agency may also add standard questions that exclude participants you would like to recruit.
