Do your research with people who are existing or potential future users of your service. Representative experts aren't substitutes for actual users.

Remember to include all [user groups](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/design-principles/#this-is-for-everyone), including those who:
 - are disabled or use assistive technologies
 - have low digital skills
 - have low literacy
 - come from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds
 - may need help to use your service

Document user groups in your [user research plan](/user-research/planning-user-research/).
