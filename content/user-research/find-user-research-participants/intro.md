Meet regularly with real people who are existing or potential future users of your services. Stakeholders and representative experts are not substitutes for actual end users.

Your research must include all the [different kinds of people](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/design-principles/#this-is-for-everyone) who may need your service, including those who:
 - are disabled or use assistive technologies
 - have low digital skills or poor literacy
 - come from cultures with different experiences of government
 - may need help to use your service

Make sure this is documented in your [user research plan](#).
