### [3]Why should you do user research?
The better you understand your users, the more likely you are to design and build a service that works well for them.

User research delivers many benefits for your agency, because you:

 - reduce the risk of expensive failures by making fewer assumptions about your users
 - reduce delivery time by having more certainty about what to build
 - are adaptable when you release increments of the service as you gain new knowledge about your users
