To deliver a service that meets your users’ needs, you have to understand:
- who your likely users are
- what they’re trying to do
- how they’re trying to do it now
- how their life or work influences what they do and how
- how they use and experience existing services

The better you understand your users, the more likely you are to design and build a service that works well for them.

### [2]Meeting the Digital Service Standard

You must do user research when designing your service as part of meeting the following criteria:
- [Criteria 1: Understand user needs](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/1-user-needs/)
- [Criteria 2: Agile and user-centred process](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/2-multidisciplinary-team/)
- [Criteria 9: Make it accessible](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/9-make-it-accessible/)
- [Criteria 10: Test the service](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/2-multidisciplinary-team/)
- [Criteria 12: Don’t forget the non-digital experience](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/12-non-digital-experience/)
- [Criteria 13: Encourage everyone to use the digital service](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/13-encourage-use-of-the-digital-service/)

The [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/) guides teams to build services that are simpler, clearer and faster.
