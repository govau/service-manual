### [3]Why should you do user research?
To deliver a service that meets your users’ needs, you have to understand:
- who your likely users are
- what they’re trying to do
- how they’re trying to do it now
- how their life or work influences what they do and how
- how they use and experience existing services

The better you understand your users, the more likely you are to design and build a service that works well for them.
