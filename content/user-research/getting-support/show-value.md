Doing research yourself helps you to gain:

- empathy with users
- in-depth understanding about what you need to build
- understanding about the relationship between the questions asked and the research findings

For these reasons, don’t outsource user research.

It’s especially important in the Discovery stage to talk to real users. This helps you and your team build empathy from the start.
