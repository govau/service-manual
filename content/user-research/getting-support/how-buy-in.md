Even if you understand the value of user research you may need to convince others.

Getting support to stand up a proper multidisciplinary team with a full-time user researcher can be hard.

### [2]Create a pitch

To start work on a new service, or improve an existing one, you may need to explain the value of user research in your pitch.

Make it clear that you can’t build a service that will meet user needs unless you can research with users through the whole product lifecycle.

### [2]Identify the problem

As part of preparing a pitch, you should already have some initial information that shows a real need for a new or improved service.

You may have this research from work on another service. It may have been informed by service analytics or direct feedback from users through your agency’s usual feedback channels. 

Make this the start of your pitch. Be confident and clearly explain the problem statement.

### [2]Work out the cost of the need

Quantitative sources like website analytics can help you establish a need for building or improving a service. They can also help you work out a cost to government for not improving a service. These should be your starting point — you’ll use qualitative techniques to identify the real problems.

There are resources that can help you calculate the return on investment of user experience and prove the value of good user experience.

### [2]Get support for the pitch

You can ask champions and digital leaders in your agency to help you. You can find these champions by talking to other teams that are following the service design and delivery process. They may have got started through the support of an influential person in your agency. 

You can use other agencies’ Digital Service Standard assessment reports to show how user research is essential to building modern digital services.

It can be helpful to refer to case studies on how user research has improved live services. 

One of the core principles of the Australian Public Service is a commitment to improve efficiency and performance.

### [2]Show your commitment with a team contract

At the outset of your project, it can be useful to formalise your commitment to user research in a  1-page team contract. This sets out, in plain English, what your team will build and how it will apply user research.

The digital leader in your agency who is responsible for the service should sign off on this contract before the team starts work. This will give the team confidence to keep talking to users to check they’re building the right thing.
