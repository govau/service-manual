When you set up a new service team, make sure everyone in the team understands why user research is important.

You must [involve the team in research](/user-research/team-research/). This means everyone in the team does some user research through the whole design and delivery process. It’s not just the person in the user researcher role.

The [user research guides](/user-research/) will help you and your team understand what you need to do.

Sharing [case studies on how user research helps teams](http://localhost:8080/user-research/#examples-and-case-studies) can help people to understand why user research is important.
