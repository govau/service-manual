To work in an agile way, service teams must be able to:
- update their understanding of users and their needs
- test new design ideas, content and features to see if they work well for all users
- understand problems users are having and how they might be resolved

This means doing user research in every iteration of every development stage — starting in Discovery and continuing through Live. Make sure your [user research plan](/user-research/planning-user-research/) shows this.

Doing this means you can:
- save time by building only the things that you know your users need
- reduce risk by learning quickly whether the things you are building work well for users
- respond to changing user behaviour and feedback to continuously improve the service

### [2]Allow enough time for research
You'll be able to develop a clear user research plan after your product kicks off. In the meantime, you can still talk about how you will schedule user research.

Throughout each development stage, user researchers should be:
- part of the team
- running user research sessions at least every 2 weeks

Build research activities and analysis sessions into the team’s regular schedule, so everyone knows when they’re happening and can make time to take part.

It can take a long time to recruit users for research, so it’s important to get this work started early.

### [2]Qualitative and quantitative research

Seek support for both qualitative and quantitative research.

Quantitative research gives you a limited view of who the users are and what they need.

Start the Discovery stage with qualitative research like in-depth interviews with users. You can use quantitative research to help you work out which groups of users you should to talk to.
