subtitle: The kind of user research you do changes as you move through the service design and delivery process.
category: User research

The needs and goals of the users define the service. You will uncover these needs and goals through your research in the Discovery stage and build on them through the other stages.

In Alpha and Beta stages you'll be testing prototypes, and in Live stage you will be researching to find out how you can improve the working service.

You will go from doing more generative research (making sure you are designing the right thing) in Discovery to more evaluative research (making sure you are designing it the right way) in the later stages.

In all stages:
- do research with a broad range of users, including those with access needs and low digital skills
- think about the [whole user experience](/service-design-delivery-process/whole-user-experience/) (including offline), not just the product you are delivering
