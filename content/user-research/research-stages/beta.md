There are two different research stages in Beta:
1. researching as you build the beta service
2. researching with users of a working beta service

### [2]1. Researching as you build the beta service

You can do more of the same research as you were doing in Alpha as you build the beta service. But you are aiming to refine a solution for launch.

Do task-based usability testing with a wide range of users.

You should decide on hypotheses in your research. These are ideas about how you think the design will meet a user need.

Use a structured approach to evaluation. This will help you to be clear about what is working well and where there is more work to be done.

Make sure you do accessibility testing with people who have access needs. Commission an accessibility review before you put the service into a working beta.

### [2]2. Researching with users of a working beta service

Keep doing what you were doing before but add:
- analytics (including reporting KPIs to dashboard)
- interviews / shadowing of real users
- live intercepts
- A/B testing (comparing 2 versions of a web page to see which performs better) or multivariate testing — think about whether the sample size will be useful to test your beta service
- feedback from frontline and operational staff
- face-to-face and remote usability tests to find usability and accessibility issues
- an accessibility audit to uncover accessibility issues and get recommended fixes
- private or public beta tests of the end-to-end service with real users, including support options
- web analytics and back-office data to measure service performance
- surveys or follow-up interviews to collect detailed feedback from service users

### [2]What you'll find out researching in Beta

From these activities you’ll typically learn:
- more about how different kinds of users experience your services
- the usability and accessibility issues you need to fix
- ways to improve your service
