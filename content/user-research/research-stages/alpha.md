quote: Throw away ideas and prototypes if they don't meet user needs.

In the Alpha stage, you try lots of different approaches to meet user needs and find out which approach works best.

This is an important stage and you should make sure you have budget for it. The Alpha stage will help you reduce the risks around:
- design — making sure you get the right scope for the service
- business processes — finding out if government can deliver the service
- technical — being sure you can integrate the service and make it secure

### [2]Work out what works, not what's popular

Be prepared to throw ideas (and prototypes) away if they do not meet user needs.

You will know that something works best because people will be able to get from one end to the other most easily. They will understand what they are doing and won't make mistakes.

Do task-based testing so that you can clearly understand which version is most effective: [we care about what works, not what people tell us they prefer](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/18/why-we-care-more-about-effectiveness-than-efficiency-or-satisfaction/).

### [2]Keep iterating and testing

Once you have a prototype (even if it’s just a paper one) you can start to test it with users.

You can see whether your ideas will meet user needs and find out if it is easy to use.

You can then use this insight to iterate your design and test again with users.

### [2]Keep on interviewing users

You can combine testing your prototypes with some discovery style interviews to continue to deepen your understanding of user needs.
