When you service reaches the Live stage you need to keep researching to make sure it is still meeting the needs of the users. It also tells you how to improve the service.

You can learn more about your users’ needs through:
- reviewing web analytics and back-office data to measure service performance
- surveys or follow-up interviews to collect detailed feedback on your service
- interviews and visits to get a deeper understanding of any problems users tell you about
- face-to-face and remote usability tests to find usability and accessibility issues with features you’ve added or changed
- A/B testing on new and changed features

###[2]How often to research in Live

The frequency and depth of your research once you reach Live depends on what you are trying to find out. For example, if you are looking to add a new component to your service, you would start discovery again. If your product is to be decomissioned, you need to find out how people use it now to know the gap that will be created when the service is gone.
