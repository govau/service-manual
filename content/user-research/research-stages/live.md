When your service reaches the Live stage, research helps you to make sure it is still meeting user needs. It also helps you make decisions on improving the service.

You can learn more about your usersâ€™ needs through:
- reviewing web analytics and back-office data to measure service performance
- surveys or follow-up interviews to collect detailed feedback on your service
- interviews and visits to get a deeper understanding of any problems users tell you about
- face-to-face and remote usability tests to find issues with new or changed features
- A/B testing on new and changed features

### [2]What you'll find out researching in Live

These research activities will usually give you:
- deeper understanding of how different kinds of users experience your service
- insights into usability and accessibility issues and how to fix them
- ideas for ways to improve your service in future

### [2]How often to research in Live

The frequency and depth of your research once you reach Live stage depends on what you are trying to find out. For example, if you were looking to add a new component to your service, you would start Discovery again.

If you are going to decommission your service, find out how people use it first. This will help you to understand the gap that will be created when the service is gone.
