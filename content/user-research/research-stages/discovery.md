Before you start to design anything, find out about your users so that you can understand how the service you’re designing can meet their needs.

### [2]Observe users

Watch how users do things now and what problems or barriers they face (contextual qualitative research).

Don't use market research for this: we want to [find the users' real problems by observation](https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/i-want-a-pony/).

### [2]Interview users

Interview and observe frontline service staff (if your agency has them).

This will help you to understand:
 - limitations of the current service
 - how staff explain some of the complexities
 - undocumented workarounds that are used to get things done

### [2]Map the user journey

Create a [user journey map](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/21/how-to-make-a-user-journey-map/) of the experience of the people who want to do the task your service provides.

Do research to understand the real journey, not just the journey the business would like to think they have.

### [2]Examine existing data

Look at the data that exists (for example, analytics, back-office workflow and support logs).

This can reveal new issues and provide quantitative evidence for qualitative insights.

### [2]Review previous user research

It's better to review previous user research after you have conducted your own primary research to avoid bias.

No matter how much research has previously been done, [the team needs to do their own research](http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2017/05/the_real_value_of_original_research/) to help build a direct understanding and empathy for the user and their needs.

### [2]What you'll find out in Discovery

You’ll have done enough research when you understand the different kinds of people who use your service and what they need from it, including those with support and access needs.

From these activities you should get:
- an understanding of what problem your service is trying to solve for the user
- a list of users’ touchpoints as they try to achieve their goal — often expressed as a [journey map](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/21/how-to-make-a-user-journey-map/), service map or mental model (alignment diagram)
- sets of needs and task models for different types of users
- key insights about users that you’ve gained from analysing the research
- a list of research gaps or limitations of the current research and opportunities for further research
- descriptions of different types of users and the characteristics that are significant for this service

### [2]Combine personas with real stories

Descriptions of users are often expressed as user profiles or personas. In general we prefer to use profiles combined with actual stories from users the team has met.

This tends to be more effective than developing personas, as empathy for an actual user is likely to be more authentic than empathy for a persona.

#### [1]Empathy walls

'This represents all of the empathy we built through Discovery with the real users. It’s a great way to introduce new people to the project. We used red post-its to flag pain points in user journeys and blue for where our research validated existing research.' — Service designer

### [2]Keep on discovering

Discovery research does not just happen in the Discovery phase. Teams need ongoing research to understand the evolving needs of their service.
