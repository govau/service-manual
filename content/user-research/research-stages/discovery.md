Before you start to design anything, find out about your users. This will help you to understand how the service you’re designing can meet their needs.

### [2]Observe users

Watch how users do things now and what problems or barriers they face. This is called contextual qualitative research. Don't use market research for this: [find the users' real problems by observation](https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/i-want-a-pony/).

### [2]Interview users

[Interview](/user-research/interviewing-users/) and observe frontline service staff (if your agency has them).

This will help you to understand:
 - limitations of the current service
 - how staff explain some of the complexities
 - undocumented workarounds that people use to get things done

### [2]Map the user journey

Create a [user journey map](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/21/how-to-make-a-user-journey-map/) of the experience of the people who want to do the task that brings them to your service.

Do research to understand the real user journey. It's more important than the journey the business would like to think users have.

### [2]Examine existing data

Look at [existing data](/user-research/planning-user-research/using-existing-research-data/). This might include analytics, back-office workflow and support logs.

This can reveal new issues and quantitative evidence that supports qualitative insights.

### [2]Review previous user research

To avoid bias, review previous user research after your own primary research.

No matter how much research has been done before, [the team needs to do its own research](http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2017/05/the_real_value_of_original_research/). This will help team members build a deeper understanding as well as empathy for the user and their needs.

### [2]What you'll find out in Discovery

From these activities you should get:
- an understanding of the problem your service is trying to solve for the user
- a list of users’ touchpoints as they try to achieve their goal — often expressed as a journey map, service map, mental model or alignment diagram
- sets of needs and task models for different types of users
- insights about users that you’ve gained from analysing the research
- a list of research gaps or limitations of the current research and opportunities for further research
- descriptions of user groups and the characteristics that are significant for this service

You’ll have done enough research when you understand:
- the different kinds of people who use your service
- what users needs from your service
- how people with support and access needs interact with your service

### [2]Combine personas with real stories

Descriptions of users are often expressed as user profiles or personas.

We prefer to use profiles combined with actual stories from users the team has met. This tends to be more effective than developing personas. Empathy for an actual user is likely to be more authentic than empathy for a persona.

### [2]Keep on discovering

Discovery research doesn't just happen in the Discovery phase. Ongoing research helps teams to understand the evolving needs of their service.
