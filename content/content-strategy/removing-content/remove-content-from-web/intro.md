This will vary depending on whether you’re decommissioning a whole website or a few pages.

## [3]Agree on timeline to delete

Set up your deletion timeline in your [removal plan](../removal-plan/). This will set out the alignment of everything and everyone with your removal.

## [3]Set up redirects

Redirects are an important part of removal. They make sure:
- you provide users with options to continue their search for information  
- your website keeps its search engine optimisation
- your website looks maintained

Talking to your ICT department is the usual process. Provide them with the list of your deleted URLs with the new URLs you’d like to redirect to. Provide them with a date to go live, so the redirect process doesn’t happen before you remove content.

When redirecting, you should consider the user journey and SEO, pointing people to the information that’s the most relevant.

Tip: Even if pages receive no traffic, it’s still important to remove and redirect them to:
- retain your SEO integrity
- lower maintenance costs
- reduce the amount of GOV.AU domains that currently exist

### [2]Using 404 pages

Use 404 pages only when they are a necessary part of the user journey. It should be easy for the user to understand the page no longer exists. Provide them with an obvious search option to find their content.

## [3]Remove any internal and external links to the page

It’s important to identify anything that is linking to your content before deleting. Use a link finder to make the job quicker.

You also need to inform any other agencies and external websites who are linking to your content. Links can often be in printed publications, so it’s good to communicate your changes.

You’ll need to remove or change all links across your website that point to your deleted content.

Tip: Don’t forget about intranets.

## [3]Change your information architecture (IA)

If you’re removing content in bulk there’s a good chance it will affect your IA. Remember to redirect to the appropriate new area and update links on your drop down menus.

More details on [information architecture](/content-strategy/information-architecture/).

## [3]Agree on communication

Internal communication around deleted content is important. Other areas of the agency (such as service centres) may need to know about any changes on the website. Use your intranets to communicate removal more widely in your agency.

This should be in your [removal plan](../removal-plan/).

## [3]Create deletion message

Sometimes you will need content that explains the removal of web information and why it no longer exists. Keep the copy clear, simple and actionable.

Add this to your [removal plan](../removal-plan/) so that you remember to keep users informed.

## [3]Deleting a Domain Name System (DNS)

DNS provides a number to your computer for a human readable name you enter. When you remove a website you should consider whether it's appropriate to remove your domain name altogether. Your ICT department will need to handle this as part of your removal plan.
