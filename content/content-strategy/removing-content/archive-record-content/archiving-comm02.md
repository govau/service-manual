## [2]If your website is not stored with the National Library
If the site youâ€™re removing is not archived with the AGWA, email them and make sure it's captured in their next website harvest: [recordkeeping@naa.gov.au](mailto:recordkeeping@naa.gov.au)

Only under special circumstances would they capture a website on request rather than automatically.
