Your agency may need to keep a record of the various versions of content. If so, you should use a recognised information management system.

A content management system (CMS) or electronic document record management system (EDRMS) are the best ways of capturing your content.

If your content hasnâ€™t been captured in a recognised information management system then you'll need to make a copy some other way.

### [2]If you're only making a minor change
All website content should be captured and managed in your CMS or EDRMS from the point of creation.

This makes sure you're able to make changes to content but also meet record requirements.
