## [3]Find out what you need to keep

Websites are Commonwealth records, so there are rules about how major changes to government websites are managed.

If you are doing a major update, or decommissioning the website, you’ll need to keep a copy of the website to meet legal and ongoing business requirements.

If it's just a minor update (for example, a few pages) you can capture the content of the website in an information management system, such as a CMS.

The records and information management people in your agency will be able to inform you about requirements for how long content needs to be kept.

They should work with you to create an Information Management Plan.

If your agency doesn't have a Records and Information Manager, then contact the National Archives: [recordkeeping@naa.gov.au](mailto:recordkeeping@naa.gov.au)

## [3]Check with the National Library if they’ve stored your website

The National Library of Australia (NLA) might capture a snapshot of your website as part of the [National Library's Australian Government Web Archive](http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/) (AGWA).

This meets Commonwealth archival requirements. So if your website is captured, you only need to consider saving a copy for your business purposes.

### [2]What to do if your website is not captured

If the site you’re removing is not archived with the AGWA, email them and make sure it's captured in the next website harvest: [recordkeeping@naa.gov.au](mailto:recordkeeping@naa.gov.au)

Only under special circumstances would they capture a website on request rather than automatically.

Tip: Be aware of certain restrictions the National Library capture might have. For example, PDFs might be stored in different systems, there could be complex JavaScript, or downloading is disallowed because of robots.txt.

## [3]When to make a copy for the National Archives

You only need to send a copy of your website to the National Archives if it has not been captured by the National Library.

In this case, you can use tools such [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/), or similar software, to snapshot your website for sending to the National Archives.
You may need to contact your ICT area to ensure that local HTML files work properly.
If you have any questions please contact the Archives via the [Agency Service Centre](http://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/support/agency-service-centre/index.aspx).

You do not need to include linked objects that are managed separately from the website, such as transactions and datasets.

## [3]Make a copy for your agency

Your agency may require you to keep a record of the various versions of content. If so, you should use a recognised information management system.

A content management system (CMS) or electronic document record management system (EDRMS) are the best ways of capturing your content.

If your content hasn’t been captured in a recognised information management system then you'll need to make a copy some other way.

## [3]If you're only making a minor change

All website content should be captured and managed in your CMS or EDRMS from the point of creation.

This makes sure you're able to make changes to content as required but also meet record requirements.
