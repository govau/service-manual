There are several ways to ensure your website has been captured as a record.

## [2]Check with the National Library if theyâ€™ve stored your website

The National Library of Australia (NLA) might capture a snapshot of your website as part of the [National Library's Australian Government Web Archive](http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/) (AGWA).

This meets Commonwealth archival requirements. So if your website is captured, you only need to consider saving a copy for your business purposes.
