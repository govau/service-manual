## [2]Send a copy to the National Archives

You only need to send a copy of your website to the National Archives if it has **not been captured by the National Library**.

In this case, you can use tools such [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/), or similar software, to snapshot your website for sending to the National Archives.
You may need to contact your ICT area to ensure that local HTML files work properly.
If you have any questions please contact the Archives via the [Agency Service Centre](http://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/support/agency-service-centre/index.aspx).

You do not need to include linked objects that are managed separately from the website, such as transactions and datasets.
