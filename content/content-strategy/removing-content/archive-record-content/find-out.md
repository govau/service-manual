Websites are Commonwealth records, so there are rules about how major changes to government websites are managed.

If you are doing a major update, or decommissioning the website, youâ€™ll need to keep a copy of the website to meet legal and ongoing business requirements.

If it's just a minor update (for example, a few pages) you can capture the content of the website in an information management system, such as a CMS.

The records and information management people in your agency will be able to inform you about requirements for how long content needs to be kept.

They should work with you to create an Information Management Plan.

If your agency doesn't have a Records and Information Manager, then contact the National Archives: [recordkeeping@naa.gov.au](mailto:recordkeeping@naa.gov.au)
