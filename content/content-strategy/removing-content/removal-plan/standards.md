As you start this removal plan, itâ€™s good practise to think about longer term strategy.

You can negotiate standard removal periods for common types of content, such as media releases or industry notices. For example, you might only retain content for current year and previous 2 years, rather than build up a large backlog online.

Publish your timeframes to remove content internally. This will help you to initiate regular content reviews and to negotiate removal periods.
