Keep all your actions in one place so that stakeholders are aware of their roles throughout the process.

1. Agreement — mark who is responsible for approving each of the removed pages and document their agreement.
2. Roles — agree who is responsible for each removal step, this includes technical requirements, communication (both internal and external), archival, content management and risk management.
3. Retention — how long do you need to keep different types of content.
4. Implementation — the tasks to [responsibly remove content](../remove-content-from-web/).
5. Schedule — so that all actions happen at the same time.
