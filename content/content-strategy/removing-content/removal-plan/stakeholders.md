It’s important to start contacting all the correct people in your agency. Know who’s involved and mark down their responsibility in a removal plan.

Core people you’ll need to talk to are:
- Content owner: reviews content for removal
- Information and records manager: owner of the archiving policy, able to tell you how long content needs to be kept
- IT: implements technical aspects, such as redirects
- Comms: communicates any decommission messaging
