Users have the right to request government information at any time as part of the [Freedom of Information Act 1982](https://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/).

Information can often be kept online because of a fear of a Freedom of Information (FOI) request or legal action.

If information is archived currently, it can be accessed at any time. Removing it from the website does not mean there's an FOI risk.

The number of FOI requests can often be minimal. So you can use this number in your evidence for removal.
