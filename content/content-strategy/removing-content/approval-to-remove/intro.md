The first step in any website removal is to make sure that all content owners agree to the content being decommissioned. This process will vary based on whether it's for a whole website or a few pages.

## [3]Watch your wording

Some agencies and stakeholders avoid using certain words because they come with the idea of risk.

If so, try to adapt your language. If ‘delete’ and ‘remove’ do not work, use softer wording like ‘retire’, ‘archive’ and ‘decommission’ when explaining your process.

## [3]Identify risks of not removing content

This is where your previous [content auditing](/content-strategy/content-auditing/) experience will come in handy. The audit will contain evidence of the potential risks of not removing your content, such as:
- a bad user journey
- outdated
- not current
- the wrong information
- SEO impact
- no page hits

## [3]Check the content has a user need

Start to think about removing pages that do not have a clear user need.

## [3]Check if content supports business goals

If the content does not match your business goals or strategy, this can aid your case for removing it.

## [3]Analyse the costs of removing or not removing content

If you have any figures on the maintenance cost of keeping content on your website, start to do an analysis on the cost of keeping each page live.

## [3]Freedom of Information (FOI) risks

Information can often be kept online because of a fear of a Freedom of Information (FOI) request or legal action.

If information is archived currently, it can be accessed at any time. Removing it from the website does not mean there's an FOI risk.

The number of FOI requests can often be minimal. So you can identify this number in your evidence for removal.
