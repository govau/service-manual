Set up content teams with content leads as points of escalation. Doers and specialists apply their expertise to the content lifecycle stages. They create and deliver quality content.

With clear lines of accountability, teams are better able to work together and to break down silos.

Regular reporting on measures of success is part of content governance. Reporting helps to build trust and get long-term buy-in.
