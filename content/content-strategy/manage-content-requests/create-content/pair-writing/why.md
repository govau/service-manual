section: Why use pair writing
---

The benefits of pair writing are:

- you are both creating content to the same user needs
- your subject expert will gain understanding of the content creation process
- continual feedback and input improves the content quality
- it helps you create an awareness of content design in business and policy areas
- it speeds up the content approval process as content decision makers are involved early on in the content development
- it avoids time-consuming back-and-forth dialogue of feedback between writer and subject expert
- the content will follow the appropriate style and tone, in line with the [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/)
- there is less chance of error and miscommunication between teams

It's best to do a pair writing exercise at the start of content development, after you have completed user research.
