### [2]Content production template

Use the [content production template](/content-strategy/manage-content-requests/create-content/content-production-template/). The template gives context for authors and reviewers. It also guides those not experienced in web writing.

### [2]Pair writing

Use [pair writing](/content-strategy/manage-content-requests/create-content/pair-writing/) to create content side-by-side with a subject expert. For example, a technical expert, lawyer or policy writer.

### [2]Content decision tree

Use the [content decision tree](/content-strategy/manage-content-requests/create-content/content-decision-tree) as a guide to help content authors question and decide if content is right or ready to publish.

### [2]Readability check

Use tools to check the readability of your content. Aim to make content as readable as possible. This makes it more accessible for everyone, not just users with low literacy. Specialist and technical audiences benefit from plain English too.

It's good to aim for an [age 9 reading level](/content-guide/writing-style/#readability). WCAG criteria 3.1.5 (Level AAA) recommends you [write to lower high school level (Australian Year 7 to 8)](/content-guide/accessibility-inclusivity/#wcag-2-0-for-content-authors). Even if you aren't able to achieve an age 9 reading level, the more readable you can make content the better it is for everyone.
