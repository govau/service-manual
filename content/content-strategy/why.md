title: Why is content strategy important?
---

All government content should be guided by a content strategy. This gives you a framework to:

- define and create content that meets your users' and agency’s needs
- improve the findability and clarity of your content
- align your people and processes to the same goals
- strengthen your agency’s workflow, sign-off and publishing check-points
- continually maintain, remove and improve your content
