## [3]Organic and paid search

The main search results are **organic results** (sometimes called natural results). These appear in a ranking order of highest to lowest. The only way to improve your ranking position is through better SEO.

**Paid results** are the paid advertisements before and near organic results. They are not affected by your site's SEO. You can buy adds through Google's AdWords or Microsoft's Bing Ads. 

This image shows 'Etax' as the paid Ad and 'Lodge online | Australian Taxation Office' as the first organic result below it.
