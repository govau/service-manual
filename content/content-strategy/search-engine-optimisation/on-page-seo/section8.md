Search engines want to know how relevant your content is to search terms. This is so they can show the most relevant search results. To achieve this, search engines look at a range of SEO factors.

Some main components used to decide on relevance include:
- [keywords](#keywords)
- [URL structure](#page-urls)
- [titles and descriptions](#metadata)
- [backlinks](../off-page-seo/#link-building-and-backlinks)
- the content itself (text, images, videos and audio)

When you optimise these components, they are more readable to search engines. The more you optimise a page for a keyword, the more likely a search engine will be to see its relevance. As a result, your search rankings will improve.
