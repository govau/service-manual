Schema is another type of metadata. It refers to a snippet of code that helps search engines understand your webpage better and rank it more highly. This may also be known as a tag, microdata or [structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data).

You can use schema to also add your business address, link to a map, contact information, location or description of your service.

Schema enhances the way web pages appear in search results. This can impact on CTR (click through rates), which also affects the ranking of your pages.

[Schema.org](http://schema.org/docs/gs.html) provides a shared markup vocabulary that is accepted and readable by many search engines. 

**Search result enhancements include:**
- business information such as location and contact information
- marketing information — name, logo, and social profiles 
- Sitelinks Searchbox — allows users to search your website directly from Google
- breadcrumb navigation — shows the page's position in the site hierarchy
- reviews from users of your service

You may need to discuss Schema with your developer or SEO team, to better understand how to use it in your SEO strategy.
