Make sure you put all the outputs of your content strategy into the template. Follow the [content strategy framework](/content-strategy) so that you can create less content, better content and less cost to produce. 

Some other rules to follow are:

* Start it at the beginning of a project
* Rebrand it
* Use it as a working document, adding information as it becomes available 
* Summarise information and link to source material, rather than duplicate
* Amend it to work in your context — it’s not one size fits all
* Keep it up to date 
* Share it regularly so that everyone is on the same page
