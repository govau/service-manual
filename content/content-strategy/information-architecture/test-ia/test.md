Conduct usability testing as you develop your IA.  Test with users at various stages of the process.

You can test your IA using software programs or a prototype of your site with a clickable IA. This could even just be a spreadsheet with collapsed/expandable sections.

It can be worthwhile to involve 1 or 2 of people who were involved in the initial user research.

You don’t need to test the IA with a lot of people. Make sure you select a range of people from your target audiences. We recommend between 5-10 people.

It can be time consuming to bring in people from outside your organisation. However, if they are users of your website, it’s worth it. 

Conduct  usability testing to:
- increase confidence for your team before the build phase
- identify any issues within the IA to be fixed
- provide an evidence base for the IA design, if people question decisions later in the process.
