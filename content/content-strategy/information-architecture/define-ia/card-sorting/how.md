Label each grouping with a post-it note as a heading.

- write it on a different coloured post-it note and add it to a group
- note down if anything is redundant

### [2]Step 9: Assess priorities:
- mark with a tick any card labels that they value
- mark a cross on any card labels they don’t understand

### [2]Step 10: Ask questions
 Ask questions to understand the kinds of content that they think will sit under those headings. Note down anything surprising.
