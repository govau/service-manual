<!-- Preparation --> 
- To prepare cards, get page-level headings/labels from the different sections of your website. 
- Write up these labels on index cards of one colour.
- Recruit a mix of people from the user groups of your website or site section. You will be testing in pairs. So you may have more than 1 pair in each session.
- Ideally, hold the activity in person so you can ask people why they made their choices.
- You may need to hold an online session. You can use card sorting software to create a URL of the activity. Then send the URL to your users to do the activity remotely, and send it back to you.
