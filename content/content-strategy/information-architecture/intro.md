Agencies need to work together to make sure IAs complement the IAs of other Australian Government websites to eliminate duplication.

There are several reasons you might need to develop a new IA or update an existing one:
- current website is out of date or in need of a refresh
- new program
- new policy
- Machinery of Government change
- changed user needs
- end of life for your existing website platform
- project evolution
- external factors, for example industry changes
- changes in responsibilities within departments
- standardising content
- poor governance of existing website
- new tools to publish
- user feedback or common queries
