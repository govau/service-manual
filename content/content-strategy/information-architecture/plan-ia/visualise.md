Use a visual tool or site map to visualise your IA as you develop it. This is also useful to show stakeholders.

Where an IA is deep and there are hundreds of pages, use additional tools to map the complete IA. The most available option is to map your full IA using a spreadsheet.

When visualising, consider using a basic linking, interlinking or deep-cross linking IA.
