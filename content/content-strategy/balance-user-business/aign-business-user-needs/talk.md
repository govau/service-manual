Make sure stakeholders understand the importance of meeting [user needs](/user-research/identifying-users-needs/). There will need to be a shared understanding of who your users are and what they need.

Stakeholders may not be familiar with the [Digital Service Standard
](/digital-service-standard/) (the Standard), and its criteria, which include:
- [Understand user needs](/digital-service-standard/1-understand-user-needs/)
- [Make it accessible](/digital-service-standard/9-make-it-accessible/)

The Standard ensures digital teams build government services that are simple, clear and fast. Remind stakeholders that agencies should meet the Standard. 

Ask stakeholders if theyâ€™ve had training in:
- [plain English writing](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/writing-style/#plain-english)
- [accessible and inclusive design](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/accessibility-inclusivity/)

If needed, run workshops and meetings with your team and stakeholders.  This is so all teams understand needs and expectations.

### [2]Ask business for information about users
Ask the business area for:
- a list of online and offline tasks users complete with them
- evidence collected from users in the past, such as survey data and customer emails
- common or recurring issues and topics in phone calls and emails from users

Also, ask the business area if they've looked at the web analytics of their current content. Find out and discuss what the analytics show about:
- how users use the content 
- how often users use it
- what search queries users type into the search engine
