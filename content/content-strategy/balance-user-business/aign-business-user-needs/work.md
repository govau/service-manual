Set up regular meetings and touch points throughout the life of the project. This will keep everyone informed, updated, and on track.

Keep stakeholders engaged and interested. Tell them about potential website improvements, issues and opportunities. For example, if there is consistent user feedback that content is hard to read, show them the feedback. Discuss why there might be readability issues and show them the proposed solution.

Also, encourage and empower stakeholders to get involved where appropriate. Tell them about the benefits of participation in the process.

For example, [pair writing](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/pair-writing/) with a technical or subject expert can be valuable. It can speed up approvals, as it involves the business area early in the contentâ€™s development. It also reduces the chance of error and miscommunication between teams.
