Stakeholders may not know the need for user-centred content, or of its business value. There may even be resistance to user-centred content. 

An awareness of what good content is, and investing in it, can lead to future savings. Show stakeholders evidence of the business value of user-centred content. For example: 
- Making content readable and accessible means more users will understand and use it.
- User satisfaction may mean thereâ€™s less need for costly improvements to content.
- More uptake of services may also mean users are less likely to use other resources like call centres.

You can also show stakeholders how others apply content best practice. This could be examples by other government agencies in Australia and overseas. Best practice examples can encourage others to be open to new ways of thinking about content.

Another option is to [recruit a content champion](/content-strategy/balance-user-business/educate-organisation/#recruit-content-champions) in the business area. They may be able to help upskill others and raise awareness of the value of good content.

There is also guidance available about [getting buy-in](/content-strategy/getting-buy-in/) in your agency.
