Stakeholders usually approach content owners with content requests. Itâ€™s best if this happens early in a business project or initiative. This can allow enough time to create content that meets user and business needs.

Content requests can sometimes happen with little notice. When this happens there may be little time to consider user needs. For example, due to this, content may be reactive rather than strategic. It may then be less user-centred and valuable.

Short-notice requests may be common in your organisation. You may need to [raise awareness in your organisation](/content-strategy/balance-user-business/educate-organisation/) of the business value of meeting user needs.

There is also guidance available about [urgent content requests](/governing-content/urgent-content-requests/).
