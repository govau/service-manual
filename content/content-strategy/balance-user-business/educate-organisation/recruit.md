A content champion can promote and raise awareness about user-centred content.

Content champions can be people from business areas. They should ideally already know about or have an interest in [writing for the web](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/writing-style/) or [content design](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/). A key contact point from a business area who acts as a champion can help bridge gaps between areas. They can also promote the value of good content to their teams and senior executives.

A content champion can recognise opportunities to upskill stakeholders about user-centred content. These opportunities include:
- training
- workshops between content and business teams
- one-on-one conversations
- showing stakeholders evidence of user needs
- showing stakeholders examples of content best practice. For example, good content by other government departments

They can also:
- act as a key contact point between teams
- make stakeholders aware of the [Digital Service Standard](/digital-service-standard/) (the Standard)
- promote and encourage [training on the Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/training/)
- share learnings and promote the importance of the user experience in their area or team
