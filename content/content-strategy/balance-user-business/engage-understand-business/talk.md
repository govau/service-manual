If your stakeholders are new to creating content, discuss the [sign-off process](/governing-content/content-lifecycle/signing-off-content/).

Your stakeholders may already publish content on internal or external websites. Find out what their current sign-off process is, as it may affect your workflow. Consider if you can improve the process and discuss this with stakeholders. 

For example, you may need to help senior executives trust the content process. This may mean they have less involvement (if appropriate) in the content process. This can allow for a faster content lifecycle.
