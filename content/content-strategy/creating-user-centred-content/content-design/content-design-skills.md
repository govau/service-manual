Content design skills include traditional editorial and writing skills, along with:
- writing and editing digital content
- user research
- service design
- stakeholder engagement

The best way to become upskilled in content design is to work in a [multidisciplinary team](/digital-service-standard/2-multidisciplinary-team/) to share knowledge, skills and processes.

Content designers often have backgrounds in areas like web editing or online copywriting.
