If you are having trouble getting buy-in for content improvement you can:
- start small: if you have pitched a new website, reduce your scope and focus on smaller priorities that can be fixed now
- build support through those you have onside already
- put standards like the Content Guide and the Digital Service Standard in place for all new content on the website
- keep key stakeholders engaged and interested by telling them about website improvements, problems and opportunities
- show stakeholders a user journey map [link to ‘Journey mapping’ in Content design topic] so they can empathise with your users and understand the pain points they experience when interacting with your service
