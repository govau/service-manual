It is useful to benchmark your current online services so that you can show the cost of poor content. Measurements can include: 

- costs of transactions over the phone or in person 
- online completion rates 
- digital take-up 
- user satisfaction 

A benchmark will help you [measure performance](/digital-service-standard/11-measure-performance/) as you improve content.

A content audit can help to prove your case as it will show what you have and what needs to be done. You will have to [prove the value of a content audit](/content-strategy/content-auditing/prove-the-value/) first.

Try to give your stakeholders options, such as a sample content audit versus a full website content audit.
