Your manager or stakeholder may be unaware of how your website stacks up against best practice benchmarks, whole-of-government requirements (eg accessibility) and similar sites.

Gather any statistics and benchmarks that can help you paint a picture of how you perform against these benchmarks and similar sites.

Looking at how other similar sites are performing can also provide you with some ideas about how you can improve your website too. This will be a useful selling point when discussing a content audit with stakeholders.
