To prove the benefits of a content audit you should first show how much can be saved by fixing bad content.

To show costs and efficiencies it helps to identify what it costs your agency to:

- handle calls relating to the clarification or lack of web content
- double-handle applications that are incorrectly completed as a result of out of date or unclear information
- police and prosecute non-compliance that could have been avoided if people knew what to do
- manage and maintain your current website and what outcomes you’re getting for that investment.

You could establish a ‘cost per view rate’ where you collate the yearly costs of managing and maintaining your site (technical costs, staffing costs, content development costs etc.) and divide this by the number of views you get from users.

With data on user satisfaction rates, you could plot the yearly spend against user satisfaction rates and see if there are any relationships or trends.

If you use different processes for managing content development and publishing, you could map these out on a process map to identify any inefficiencies or blockages in the current process that you could potentially remove.
