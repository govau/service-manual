Your manager or stakeholder may be unaware of how your websites measure against [content best practice](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/) (for example, user-centred, accessible content written in plain English), and whole-of-government requirements (for example, the [Digital Service Standard](/digital-service-standard/)).

Gather any statistics and data that can help you paint a picture of how you perform against these benchmarks, criteria and similar sites.

Look at similar sites to get ideas about how you can improve your website. This will be useful when pitching your content audit to stakeholders.
