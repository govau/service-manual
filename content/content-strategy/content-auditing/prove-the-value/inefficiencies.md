To prove the benefits of a content audit you should first show how much can be saved by fixing bad content.

To show costs and efficiencies it helps to highlight what it costs your agency to:

- handle calls relating to the clarification or lack of web content
- double-handle applications that have been incorrectly completed as a result of out-of-date or unclear information
- police and prosecute non-compliance that could have been avoided if people knew what to do
- manage and maintain your current website and what outcomes you’re getting for that investment

You could calculate a ‘cost per view rate’ by collating the yearly costs of managing and maintaining your site. Costs could include technical, staffing and content development. Then divide this by the number of views you get from users.

With data on user-satisfaction rates, you could plot the yearly spend against user-satisfaction rates and see if there are any relationships or trends.

If you use different processes for managing content development and publishing, you could map these out on a process map. This is a way of finding any inefficiencies or blockages in the current process, which you could potentially remove.
