Our website is often the first thing about us that people notice – and first impressions last.

While expert user research is preferred, there are some low-cost ways to get user feedback, including running a short survey on your website, or asking users for their feedback via your other channels (eg contact centres or on social media). If you have direct access to a pool of users, you might run a small focus group or short interviews to help you understand who your users are and how they experience your website.

To help your stakeholders understand empathy with your users, you can try:
- asking them to find something on the website using the site's navigation menu and Google or another search engine
- asking them to find something on a similar-sized organisation’s website using the site’s navigation menu and Google or another search engine.
