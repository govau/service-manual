Your manager or stakeholder may be unaware of how your website stacks up against best practice benchmarks, whole-of-government requirements (for example, accessibility) and similar government sites.

Gather any statistics and benchmarks that can help you paint a picture of how you perform against these benchmarks and similar sites.

Look at how other similar sites are performing to get ideas about how you can improve your website. This will be useful when selling your content audit to stakeholders.
