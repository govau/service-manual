Your website is often the first thing about you that people notice and first impressions last.

While [expert user research](/user-research/) is preferred, there are some low-cost ways to get user feedback. You could run a short survey on your website, or ask users for feedback via your other channels (for example, contact centres or on social media). If you have access to a pool of users, you can run a small focus group or short interviews. This will help you understand who your users are and how they experience your website.

To help your stakeholders find empathy with your users, you can try asking them to find something:
- on your website using the site's navigation menu and Google or another search engine
- on a similar-sized organisation’s website using the site’s navigation menu and Google or another search engine
