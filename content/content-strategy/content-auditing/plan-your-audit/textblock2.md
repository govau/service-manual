Using your websiteâ€™s purpose as a focus, try to articulate a high-level goal for the audit. For example if you were auditing a health campaign website your goal could be to help people find information about national sport programs.

If the audit is being done because of external factors (for example, due to a Machinery of Government (MoG) change), some tasks will have a higher priority than others.

In this case you will probably be thinking about:
- tweaking the information architecture (IA)
- retiring a website or websites
- trying to understand what content you have overall so you can work out how much needs to be deleted or archived, updated and improved
