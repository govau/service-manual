Some websites can change over time or get hijacked by similar websites under the same policy.
The audit will help you discover whether your website is still doing what it was intended to do. For example:
- has the original purpose changed?
- if the purpose has changed, is it confusing for people visiting the site to find what they need?
- if people are no longer coming to that website should it be retired?
