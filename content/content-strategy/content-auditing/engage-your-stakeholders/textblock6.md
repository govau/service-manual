It’s hard to audit content that’s changing.

Be aware of any upcoming publishing requirements that need to be factored in during your audit such as ministerial announcements and legislative changes.

You might consider implementing a content freeze to help you manage the workload. A content freeze is a process that restricts the amount of new content published or content changes that can be made on the website during a content audit. You will need to negotiate the scope of the freeze and timeframes with executives and content owners.
