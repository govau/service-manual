Your audit will have more chance of success if you have an agreed process. Start by having a discussion with your stakeholders and team to agree on roles and responsibilities for the content audit. For example, find out who has the authority to do what is needed to ensure the quality of content and its ongoing maintenance.

If you donâ€™t know who the stakeholders or page owners are you could run an internal survey. Your survey should ask people to indicate whether they need to have input into specific content.
