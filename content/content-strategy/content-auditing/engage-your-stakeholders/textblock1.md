Before your content audit, get buy-in from everyone involved, ideally from the top down. Bring them along on the journey with regular communication and evidence of what’s not working well.

Forging early agreements will pave the way for the project to proceed smoothly. 

Seek agreement on

- the purpose of the website or section you are auditing
- the purpose of the audit
- the scope and timeline of the content audit
- how the content audit will be conducted and timeframes
- roles and responsibilities
- challenges you’re likely to face
- how you’d like them to support you
