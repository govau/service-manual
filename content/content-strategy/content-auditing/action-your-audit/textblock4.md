In other instances you may need to decide on how best to retain content for archiving. The tasks involved may vary, for example:
- remove entirely from the IA
- store in soft copy to be available for Freedom of Information (FOI) requests
- group archived material on new or existing pages to retain online access

Add ‘archive’ as a task to the audit spreadsheet as you go.
