Through an audit report you can illustrate valuable points around your content to get internal stakeholder support to action the data. For example:
- the amount of targeted content on your website
- any information architecture (IA) or navigation problems
- how much inaccurate or out-of-date content there is

Using this data, you can frame problems by showing them as percentages, for example ‘45% of our online content is out of date’.

Diagrams and charts can also help you to visually present the current state.

The [UK Government Digital Service content audit template](/assets/files/gov.uk-example-audit-sheet.xlsx) has a clear and simple automated summary on the first page.
