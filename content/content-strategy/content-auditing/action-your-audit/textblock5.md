Some content will need reworking. Think about this as you’re analysing the content.

The tasks may involve making your content clearer by:
- rewriting in the active voice and reducing the number of words
- rewriting in plain English and improving readability and accessibility
- updating the information to be accurate and current
- making the content task-focused and including a call-to-action

Add ‘rewrite’ as a task to the audit spreadsheet as you go.
