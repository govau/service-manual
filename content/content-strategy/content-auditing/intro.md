Content auditing takes a close look at your digital estate. This could be anything from 50 websites to 15 applications or a single service. You can gain a clear understanding of what you have and where it lives – even if only to begin thinking about maintenance or content removal.

During the task you will gather evidence to make decisions and plan actions such as:
- removing unnecessary content
- improving the quality of what remains
- identifying content gaps

## [2]Why audit content?
Around 55% of Australians who look up government information and services online experience a problem as [research tells us](https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/creating-good-content/). Government publishes a lot of information and it can be hard to understand. Users often find it hard to work out what we are asking them to do.

A good content audit can help you scope and budget for content improvement and reduction projects.

It also helps you create benchmarks to report on improvements over the content lifecycle.
