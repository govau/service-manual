Content auditing takes a close look at your digital estate. This could be anything from 20 websites to 15 applications or a single service. You can gain a clear understanding of what you have and where it lives â€“ even if only to begin thinking about maintenance or content removal.

During the task you will gather evidence to make decisions and plan actions such as:
- removing unnecessary content
- improving the quality of what remains
- identifying content gaps

These outcomes will support the creation of benchmarks and allow you to report on improvement for the content lifecycle.

Audits also help you to scope and budget for content projects.
