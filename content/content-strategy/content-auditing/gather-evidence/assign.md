Assign page owners or subject matter experts to each item in the spreadsheet to identify who can authorise actions for sections of content. Also make a note if there is no owner. See [Identifying stakeholders](/content-strategy/content-auditing/engage-your-stakeholders/#identify-stakeholders) for ideas about finding owners.

For maintaining and updating content metadata (such as page owners) where possible, store metadata information with the content, within the CMS.
