Use a spreadsheet to manually create a complete list of data. This could include pages, documents, applications and videos â€“ see the content audit template under [Tools](#tools) for examples of what to include.

Otherwise you can try and export your pages to a spreadsheet from a CMS or analytics tool to give you a complete list of all pages on the site. Go through this spreadsheet to remove content that is not a true page (for example, search result query string URLS) or pages not included in the content audit.
