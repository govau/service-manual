A ‘qualitative evaluation’ helps to decide whether the content supports a user need when they interact with government.
Get a content expert to evaluate each content item in the spreadsheet, applying best practice guidelines, the GOV.AU Content Guide and relevant tools (if available). You should assess against the following:

Usability
- Who is the intended user of the content?
- Does the content clearly outline what the user needs to know?
- Does the content have a clear path to a call-to-action?
- Is the user directed through the information with easily scannable subheadings?
- Are links informative?
- Can the user find or do what they need to do?
- Is this the best way to present the information? For example, is the content outlining a process and if so, would it be more usable as a calculator?
- Have you analysed and actioned your user feedback?

Findability
- Does the navigation help the user find information?
- Are the information arcitecture (IA) labels easy to understand?
- Is the meta description written as a call-to-action using relevant keywords?
- Is the information easily found using the site’s search?
- Is the information easily found using a search engine?
- Is the content in an html format?
- Is the content written using phrases and words your users are likely to use?
- Is content linking off to credible and authoritative online sources of content?
- Is the content heading length optimised for search?

Readability
- Does the first sentence help users decide if the page is relevant?
- Is the content written in plain English and structured for web best practice?
- Does the content use active voice and have a consistent tone across the website?
- What is the page’s readability level?

Accessibility
- Content needs to meet WCAG 2.0 accessibility requirements.
- Is the content written so that all users can read and understand? For example, people who speak English as a second, third or fourth language.
- Are the headings structured and do images provide meaningful alt text
- Are closed captions, audio descriptions for visual text and a transcript provided for videos?
- Are closed captions in videos able to be turned off?
- Are links written for accessibility?
- Is the content responsive to mobile devices?
- Are documents or PDF formats needed or can they be condensed into web page content?
- If documents or PDF formats are needed, are they accessible and do they accompany an html extract or description?
- Are images decorative? If so, consider removing.
- Do all images include meaningful alt text?
- Are any data tables formatted correctly using table headers and table captions?
