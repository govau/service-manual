Use data from web analytics tools to measure, rate, test and evaluate content. This can include things like page views, bounce rate, page referral, search referral, new versus returning visitors, and user feedback.

Review the analytics provided by site search. If users are looking for specific content on your site and not finding it (either because it doesnâ€™t exist or it is not findable) it may show a content gap. It may also show a need to update how content is written or where it is published.
