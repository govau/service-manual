CMS customisation is all about continual improvement.

There are 2 kinds of customisation:
- functional customisation — changing the way the CMS works
- cosmetic customisation — changing the way the CMS looks

Different CMSs have different levels of custom default behaviour. Some are flexible, others are more restrictive. Knowing what you need from your CMS helps you to know if it has enough built-in support.
If you need to make changes, you may need to hire specialist developers. This can be expensive and time consuming.
