- **Training** 

    Who will need CMS training in your agency? How often is it offered? What is the learning curve like for new people?


- **Support** 

    Is there a developer support community in Australia? Is it online, face to face, 24/7? Overseas based support can mean a delay in time zones.


- **Updates** 

    How often is the CMS updated to the next version? How might this affect your website content or CMS use?


- **Future changes or customisation** 

    If you want to make custom changes to your CMS in future, what is the process for this?


- **Open-source** 

    Any new code being written for your CMS deployment should be licenced for re-use. See the [Digital Service Standard criterion 8](/digital-service-standard/8-make-source-code-open/), 'make source code open.'
