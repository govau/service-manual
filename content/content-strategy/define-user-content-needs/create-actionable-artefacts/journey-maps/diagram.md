You can map your user’s journey in a way that suits your team. It doesn’t need to be a linear timeline.
Represent the user’s journey in swimlanes. Use visuals to communicate points on your journey. Use post-it notes on a wall or a marker on butcher’s paper to show: 
  * your user — describe their age, background, thoughts, feelings, opinions, expectations and pain points
  * timeline — define the scope of the user’s journey in their context 
  * touchpoints — how users interact with your agency and various levels of government, at different points in the journey 
  * emotions — how the user feels in the journey
  * channels — how they are interacting with your agency (this could include website, mobile app, call centre or shopfront)
