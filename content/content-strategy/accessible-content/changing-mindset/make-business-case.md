To make government information accessible you may need to [develop a business case](https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/). This could help make a significant impact on your content.

Your business case could emphasise:

- legislation and policies that require public services to be available to all. For example, anti-discrimination legislation or information and communications technology (ICT) policy
- social responsibility
- savings from improving server performance and reducing site maintenance
- cost benefits of enabling people with disabilities and older users to interact with you online.
