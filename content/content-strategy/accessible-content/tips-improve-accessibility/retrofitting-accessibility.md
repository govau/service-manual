When making changes to information that has been published as inaccessible content, reassess whether you can reduce or simplify it.

Putting the needs and contexts of users first is a good start in making information understandable and accessible. This is particularly relevant for high-profile information that attracts high volume traffic.

In the case of non-HTML formats, create an extract of the information to help a user decide if they want to download the full document. It takes time and resources to fully restructure the non-HTML information. In some cases you will need to allocate budget. This may not be justifiable, depending on the demand for the information.
