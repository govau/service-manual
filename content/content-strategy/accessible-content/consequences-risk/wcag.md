Australian government agencies must conform with [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) 2.0 (WCAG 2.0). This covers the internet, intranet and extranet websites.

The [Web Accessibility National Transition Strategy](https://www.finance.gov.au/archive/publications/wcag-2-implementation/) (2010-2014) set a target of compliance with the World Wide Web Consortiumâ€™s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0 level AA (WCAG 2 AA) by December 31 2014. The intent was for agencies to continue this for all new websites and web applications.

In WCAG 2.0, level Single A (A) is the basic. It progresses to Double A (AA) and Triple A (AAA). Triple A is the most technically difficult level. It provides accessibility for a wider range of users. We recommend you apply parts of level AAA in some circumstances. For example, use Auslan for national emergency and compliance information. The W3C notes that with Triple A, some users will still experience some difficulty in accessing content.

### [2]WCAG 2.1

WCAG 2.1 is now under development ([see the working draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)). Its guidance will include cognitive impairment, low-vision issues, and mobile web. It will be available in mid 2018.
