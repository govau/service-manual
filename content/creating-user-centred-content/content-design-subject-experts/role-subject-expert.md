Subject experts are valued in content design for their knowledge of the topic area.
 
Content creators can help experts create accurate, relevant and current content that meets:
- user needs
- accessibility requirements
- readability standards
- the [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/)

Often experts are ‘content owners’ that are responsible for fact checking and approving content before it's published. But the level of involvement experts have in content design can vary, from writing the content, to working side-by-side with writers, to simply checking the content is correct.
