Having a basic understanding of content design will help you communicate information to your users effectively. It will save you time as there will be fewer changes to the content and your content will most likely meet a user need.
 
### [2]Think about your user
Don’t make assumptions about users. Use existing research or get a user researcher to investigate your users and what their needs are.
 
Remember, users don't want to be on a government website. Usually they have to be there to complete a task or access information.
 
They shouldn't have to know a department's organisational structure to find what they need. You need to connect information and services in a way that makes sense to users.
 
You can then [test your content](/creating-user-centred-content/testing-content/) to make sure users can do what they need to do.
 
### [2]Benefits of content design
Content design is about creating well-structured and clear content that meets a user need. Read more about [content design](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/).
 
Well-designed content will help you:
- communicate information to your user quickly and easily
- save time, money and people by helping users access information they need through content, rather than call centres or face-to-face help
- create content that isn’t rejected by web publishing teams for style, accessibility or online publishing reasons
- create content that meets a user need
- create content for everyone

### [2]Role of the content creator
Trust the expertise of web publishing teams and/or communication teams and their knowledge of best practice digital methods.
 
The content creation process can be smoother if content creators are involved earlier. You can do this through [pair writing](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/pair-writing/) with writers or editors.
 
### [2]Content workflows
The subject expert role is part of a larger process that contributes to the department’s digital estate.
 
It’s useful to know what content is on your digital platforms. This reduces the chance of duplication and allows you  to connect separated content.
 
It’s also useful to understand your department’s workflow. Talk to the web publishing team early on to work out when your involvement is needed.
 
### [2]Write in plain English
Legally, government content needs to be available for users. That means creating content that is clear and easy to understand.
 
Plain English doesn’t mean ‘dumbing down’. Technical content can be written to help your users access and comprehend the information they need quickly. 
 
You can test your content’s readability level using tools like [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com) or Microsoft Word’s readability check.
 
### [2]Write for the web
Writing for online platforms is very different to writing for print. To improve your digital content you should:
- break up text with headings — users should be able to understand the context of your content by reading your headings
- write in short sentences and short paragraphs
- use bullet lists
- avoid jargon
- use a tone that is clear and friendly, and not too formal
- front-load your sentences with important information — users generally read on screen in an [F-shaped pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/)
- consider your user’s cognitive load: keep information short and concise
- write in the [active voice](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/writing-style/#voice)
- include a call-to-action — what do you want the user to do with this content?

### [2]Make your content accessible
Your information needs to be accessible to a wide range of users and follow the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag).
 
Use a web page (HTML) instead of a document. HTML is far more accessible than a PDF or Word document. If you do use documents you should include both formats and make sure your documents are accessible.
 
Find out how to make your [content accessible](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/accessibility-inclusivity/).
 
Talk to your web publishing team for guidance about making your content accessible. They will often have knowledge and expertise in this area.
 
### [2]Think about format
Think about the best format for your user. This could be text, video, audio or graphics.
 
For example, if you are explaining a very technical process it may be best represented in an infographic.
 
If using images, you must attribute the source. You also need to make sure your [images are accessible](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/accessibility-inclusivity/#images-and-alt-text).
 
Avoid using [frequently asked questions (FAQs)](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/types-of-content/#faqs) and [PDF fact sheets](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/types-of-content/#fact-sheets).
 
### [2]Pair writing
Writing your content with a content creator will make sure it follows the Content Guide, is accessible and meets readability requirements.
