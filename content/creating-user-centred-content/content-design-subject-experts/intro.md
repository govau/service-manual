The relationship between a subject expert and a content creator plays a major role in content development.
 
Subject experts need your expertise in content design. You need an expert for their specialised technical knowledge. Experts can have useful insights about users through their experience in other channels. For example, they may have worked in a call centre or shop front.

Workflow processes are different in every department. Sometimes subject experts create content and then deliver it to a web editor, publisher or writer to publish live on a platform. Read more about [content governance models](/governing-content/content-governance-models/).
 
Itâ€™s best for both subject expert and content creator to be involved early in the process so that content is accurate and publishable. Even specialised technical content needs to be written for everyone.
