For example, a pregnant woman will have to interact with government at different times throughout her pregnancy experience as she applies for financial support, registers her baby, and so on.

A user journey map:
- gives you a perspective of the user’s experience, thinking, pain points and points of interaction with your service
- helps define scope and shows you where to solve problems by highlighting user pain points
- breaks down business area silos so you can understand the complete user experience across a service
