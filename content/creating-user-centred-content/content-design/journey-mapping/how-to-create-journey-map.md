Journey maps are useful during the [Discovery](/service-design-delivery-process/discovery-stage/) phase of content design. They help to put the user first and highlight pain points you should address in your content.

A good user journey map is based on [user research](/user-research). Your journey map won’t be a successful exercise if you make assumptions or guess about people’s real-life experiences.

### [2]Step 1: Decide on your user
You need to define the user in your story. You should do this by using evidence from user research so the journey is realistic.

Quantitative research is good, but you really need [qualitative research](https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/i-want-a-pony/) to give you the insights to how users think and feel through their journey.

Focus on 1 user. This will allow you to focus on 1 story.


### [2]Step 2: Choose the scenario
Define the scope of the experience you are going to map.

For example, this could be a new cafe registering their business. Your map may cover the journey from the initial business plan through to registration and opening the business.

Make sure you define a clear goal for the user. For the example above, the goal would be to register a business.

### [2]Step 3: Visualise the journey
You can map your user’s journey in a way that suits your team. It should include:
- your user — describe their age, background, thoughts, feelings, opinions, expectations and pain points
- touchpoints — this is how users interact with your agency and various levels of government at different points of the journey (what the user is doing)
- emotions — how the user is feeling at that moment in the journey
- timeline — you need to define the scope of the journey in terms of what you are able to address
- channels — how they are interacting with your agency (this could include website, mobile app, call centre or shop front)

### [2]Step 4: Share your journey map
Display your journey map in a prominent spot so your team and stakeholders can view it.

Walk stakeholders through the journey. By sharing this with them you can encourage empathy for your users and an understanding of the challenges they face.

Show how your journey map aligns with a business goal to better persuade stakeholders of the benefits of meeting user needs.
