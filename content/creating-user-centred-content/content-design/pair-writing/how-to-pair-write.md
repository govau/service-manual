### [2]Step 1: Pair up
It’s best for a content design pair to include a subject matter expert and a content expert.

You can organise this one-on-one or in a workshop scenario with several pairs working at once.

If you are working remotely you can pair write using video conferencing and a collaborative tool such as Google Docs or Microsoft Word.

Be clear to your partner about:
- how much time you need from them
- the structure of the writing sessions
- deadlines

Let your partner know they are there for their expertise in a certain area. They don't have to be a strong writer.

### [2]Step 2: Start with user needs
At the start of the session you need to outline your user needs and the aim of the content. The aim may include a business need or the subject matter expert’s objective for the content.

Articulating the user needs at the start will put you both in the same mindset, working towards the same goal.

If you are in a workshop it’s useful to get group feedback on your user needs and content objective.

### [2]Step 3: Outline your roles
One person will be the main writer and the other is the observer. The observer’s role is to study and question the content, looking at:

- jargon — is there a plainer way of writing it?
- user needs — does the content meet user needs?
- meaning — is the content clear?
- style — does the content follow the [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/)?

You should swap roles so you both experience writing and observing.

### [2]Step 4: Create the content
Write for 10 to 15 minutes and then stop to discuss and review your writing. After this, it’s good to swap roles and start the process again.

If the writer is uncomfortable with an observer watching them write, try giving the writer space to write and then coming back together.

Keep your sessions to around 1 hour as many people need time to get used to writing with someone next to them. The process is very productive, but quite intensive.
