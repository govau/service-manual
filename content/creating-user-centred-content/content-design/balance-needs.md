section: Balance user needs with business needs

Government content can be driven by reactive business priorities, such as ministerial announcements or changes in legislation.

But an awareness of what good content is, and investing in it, can lead to future savings. For example, providing translated content may mean that users don't need to access interpreter services or seek face-to-face services.

A content designer needs to acknowledge business needs (what does the user really have to know), but work to align these with user needs (what does the user really need to know).
