Always meet face-to-face with people you’re creating content with. That will make sure you’re both on the same page about the intent of the content and the user need you are meeting.

You can then use a collaborative tool such as Microsoft Word or Google docs to start a conversation about the content. Or you can try [pair writing](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/pair-writing).

It may help to introduce experts to content design through guidance, training in writing for the web or a quick discussion on best practice.
