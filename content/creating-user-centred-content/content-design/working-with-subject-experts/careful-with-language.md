Try not to use technical language when talking with subject experts. Some people may not know about digital terms and methods. Use plain English instead.

Make sure experts are clear about why, what and how you are creating content.

Many subject experts will use technical language specific to their field and may have been writing in that style for a long time. Work with them to understand where technical language might be needed and where it can be written in plain English.

Reassure the subject expert that presenting the same information in plain English is not 'dumbing down' the text. It makes information more accessible to a wider, non-technical audience.
