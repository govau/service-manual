Job stories can be used when you have the same user/s for each story and your stories are starting to sound repetitive. A job story helps you create more detail.

Job stories follow the format:
- When … (what situation is the user in)
- I want to … (what is the user trying to do or need)
- So … (what is the user’s goal)

For the readability example above the user is a content designer and the job story could be:
- When I am creating content
- I want my content to be written simply
- So that it can be understood by people with lower literacy levels
