Job stories can be used when you have the same user/s for each story and your stories are starting to sound repetitive. A job story helps you create more detail.

Job stories follow the format:
- When … (what situation is the user in)
- I want to … (what is the user trying to do or need)
- So … (what is the user’s goal)

For the readability example above the user is a content designer and the job story could be:
- When I am creating content
- I want my content to get a readability score of between 5 and 9
- So that my content is accessible to people with lower literacy levels
