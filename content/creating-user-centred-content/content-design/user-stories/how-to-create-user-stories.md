### [2]Step 1: Research your users
First, you need to know who your users are and what their pain points are when accessing your information. This information is found through your [user research](/user-research).

### [2]Step 2: Use pain points to write your stories
Once you have these pain points you can write your stories in response to them. Jot them on an index card so you can visualise and group your stories.

The most common format for a user story is:
- As a ... (who is the user: be as specific as possible)
- I want to / need to ... (what task is the user trying to do)
- So that ... (why does the user want to do this task and what is their goal)

For example:
- As a young person entering the workforce for the first time
- I need to know what I should be getting paid (minimum wage)
- So that I can negotiate/check this with my employer

### [2]Step 3: Start broad, then get detailed
Keep your stories simple, focused, concise and active. Begin with broad stories by focusing on the overall goal. Then gradually break this down to create stories that reflect an individual task.

For example, an overarching story might be:

- As a content designer
- I need to create user-centred content
- So that my content meets a user need

A more detailed task-based user story under this could be:
- As a content designer
- I need to understand readability requirements
- So that my content is clear and accessible to people with low literacy levels

### [2]Step 4: Write acceptance criteria
To measure how your content meets a user story you can write acceptance criteria on the back of your index cards. When you meet the acceptance criteria you have completed the user story.

For our readability example above, acceptance criteria might be that:
- content is in plain English
- content was tested with a readability tool and scored between a Year 5 (around age 9) and Year 9 (around age 13) reading level
- content is tested for comprehension with users

Acceptance criteria should state a high-level intent, rather than a solution. You don’t need more than 4 acceptance criteria.

Acceptance criteria can be used to [test your content](/creating-user-centred-content/testing-content/) and [measure performance](/digital-service-standard/11-measure-performance/).

### [2]Step 5: Map your stories
Map your user story cards in a tree format. Start with the broad overarching stories at the top of the tree and then map more specific user needs below this.

Group related tasks together so you can visualise how the content may fit together to meet a certain need.

For detailed guidance see Jeff Patton’s [user story mapping](http://jpattonassociates.com/user-story-mapping/).

Mapping your needs will also help you outline your [minimum viable product (MVP)](/service-design-delivery-process/alpha-stage/#define-the-minimum-viable-product). This shows the minimum stories you need to work to for the content to meet the overall goal.

By prioritising content this way, you can create an MVP for testing. Everything not prioritised can go in your backlog to work on later.

### [2]Step 6: Write content to match your user stories
Once you have a detailed story map you can create content that aligns with your stories.

Traditionally, in an Agile team, developers use user stories to create tasks for each sprint. User stories can also help provide the structural outline to your content.

Your content should meet the acceptance criteria for a story. This is so your content meets a user need.

As you’re creating content, keep referring back to your user story map to stay on track and remember what the user needs to know.

Testing may highlight that your user stories need to be iterated. User needs change, so stories have to adapt to follow these.
