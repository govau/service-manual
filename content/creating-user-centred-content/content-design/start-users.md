A good content designer always asks what the user need is and how to meet this need. Be careful not to exclude user groups or assume what services users might need. Always think about [inclusivity and diversity](/user-research/identifying-users-needs/#make-your-research-inclusive).

To create user-centred content you need to [research your users](/creating-user-centred-content/using-existing-research), which includes using existing research.
Analysing your research will help you [identify users and their needs](/user-research/identifying-users-needs).
