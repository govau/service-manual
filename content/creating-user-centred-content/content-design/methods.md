There are several activities that will help you create user-centred content, including:
- [User stories](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/user-stories/) help you define a user need.
- [Journey mapping](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/journey-mapping/) helps you understand a user’s experience and how your content fits into that.
- [Mental modelling](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/mental-modelling/) involves creating a diagram that helps you understand a user’s thoughts and behaviours.
- [Top tasks](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/top-tasks/) help you prioritise content by listing the top tasks a user is trying to complete.
- [Pair writing](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/pair-writing/) is an effective way to create content alongside a subject matter expert.
