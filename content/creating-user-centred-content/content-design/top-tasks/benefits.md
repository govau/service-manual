Users are on your website to complete a task. By prioritising these tasks you can focus on the ‘top tasks’ to meet the greatest number of user needs.

For detailed guidance on top tasks see Gerry McGovern’s article on [A list apart](https://alistapart.com/article/what-really-matters-focusing-on-top-tasks) and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@gerrymcgovern/identifying-customer-top-tasks-ee228206b6ed).

The size of your top tasks activity depends on your team's needs, time and budget. For a large scale project, it’s best to get guidance from an experienced user researcher, service designer or specialist in this area.
