### [2]Step 1: Research user tasks
To find the top tasks for users you can use information you already have, or use data from:
- frontline staff feedback
- surveys to staff and users
- social media
- interviews with key stakeholders to find out what they consider to be user top tasks
- similar websites (to see their top tasks)
- site behaviour analysis
- search analysis

Keep in mind that you may not have content for top tasks yet. Any research into your website analytics may show the current state, not what might be missing.

### [2]Step 2: List your tasks
Start by creating a list of all the website tasks, for example:
- read the blog
- lodge a tax return
- register a business
- contact the department

Keep tasks broad, gender-neutral and free of demographics. Avoid bias.

Your first list will likely be very long.

If you are short on time and resources you can create a list for a section of your website.

### [2]Step 3: Refine your task list
You can refine your list with your stakeholders. Reduce it to under 100 tasks by removing:
- duplicates
- audience-specific tasks
- high-level goals

For tips on prioritising your list read Gerry McGovernâ€™s [Managing your task list](http://gerrymcgovern.com/managing-your-task-list/).

### [2]Step 4: Get users to vote
Once you have created your top task shortlist you can send this out to users to vote on. You can do this through a survey emailed to a group of users. Ask them to vote on their top 5 tasks in order of preference.

This exercise will generally reveal patterns and show the most important tasks. This will help you prioritise content development and improvement to make sure users can complete these tasks.
