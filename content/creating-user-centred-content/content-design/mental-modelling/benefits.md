A mental model looks at what the user thinks, what they know and how they behave. This is useful as it helps you anticipate a userâ€™s behaviour, and then design a system that meets the need driving this behaviour.

The mental model diagram bridges the gap between what the designer thinks and what the user thinks.

It helps you differentiate your user needs. Different groups of users will have very different needs and, potentially, end goals.
