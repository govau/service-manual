### [2]Step 1: Start with user research
Mental modelling involves [user research](/user-research) to get insight to your user behaviours and thoughts.

### [2]Step 2: Define the scope
Define the scope of the experience you are going to map.

A mental modelling exercise can be as small or as large as needed. It depends on your project.

A small exercise could include a few people from your web publishing team focusing on the mental model for a section of a website. For example, this may include a web editor, user researcher, content strategist and user experience or interaction designer.

A large mental model exercise could also involve subject matter experts, senior leadership and decision makers looking at the whole website. It may help to have a service designer or user researcher lead the exercise if it is on a large scale.

### [2]Step 3: Map your diagram

Clear a wall space and get a lot of post-its and textas

Mental model diagrams map behaviours, beliefs and reactions above a horizontal timeline in towers, while the systems that support these are listed underneath the timeline.

For an example of a mental model diagram see Daniel Eizans’s article [Mental modeling for content work: creation](http://danieleizans.com/2012/03/mental-modeling-for-content-work-creation/).

### [2]Step 4: Synthesise your notes
Digitise your post-it diagram.

Start to look for behaviour and thought patterns and group these together. You will start to see the motivations emerge behind certain systems and aspects of your website.

You can then make sure your content matches your user’s mental model.
