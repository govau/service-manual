Make content as readable as possible. This makes it more accessible for everyone, not just users with low literacy. Specialist and technical audiences benefit from plain English too.

It's good to aim for a Year 5 reading level (around age 9). WCAG criteria 3.1.5 (Level AAA) recommends you write to lower high school (Year 8 or 9) level.

Even if you can't achieve a Year 5 reading level, the more readable you can make content the better it is for everyone.

There’s [readability guidance](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/writing-style/#readability) available on the Content Guide.

You can also use the DTA’s [plain English word list](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/writing-style/#plain-english). For example:

- instead of ‘ascertain’, use ‘find out’
- instead of ‘implement’, use ‘apply’, ‘install’, or ‘do’
- instead of ‘subsequently’, use ‘after’
