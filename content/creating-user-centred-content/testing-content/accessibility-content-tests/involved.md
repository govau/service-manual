Within your team and organisation, you can encourage empathy for diverse users by:

- including team members and stakeholders in usability testing where possible. Let them see diverse users using their content
- having content designers check their content through the tools that users are using. For example, check how a [screen reader](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/accessibility-inclusivity/#screen-readers) reads your content
- regularly sharing your diversity and inclusivity findings
