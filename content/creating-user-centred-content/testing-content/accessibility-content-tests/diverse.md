Understanding and including diverse users should be an ongoing consideration in your testing. Make sure your users can access information in your web service.

The best way to test this is with diverse users, through task-based observation.

Cultural and language differences may affect users' ability to understand the consequences and rights of participating in research. For example, a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) user may feel compelled to agree with a researcher. They may also try to please the researcher due to a perceived imbalance in power.

English words used in your content may also have unintended connotations. Test with CALD users to identify which concepts or words do not translate well.

Test content with CALD users with a trusted intermediary present.

You should also:

- use an interpreter to ensure youâ€™re understood
- translate supporting documents and forms
- use visual cues on consent documents
- test in a neutral, external space, instead of government buildings
- make sure the user understands the purpose of the research and the results
