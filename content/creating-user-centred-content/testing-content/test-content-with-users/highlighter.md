Highlighter testing is an effective and easy way to find out users' attitudes and feelings towards your content.

It involves giving users different coloured highlighters to highlight certain parts of the text. The colours should signify different reactions, for example:

- green could show content that is easy to understand and/or makes the user feel confident
- yellow could highlight the user is unsure, or confused
- red could show the content isn’t useful

In testing sessions, ask users why they highlighted the content the way they did. If there are large sections with no highlighting, ask why. For example, if most of your users ignore a large section and say it’s not relevant to them, you may not need it.
