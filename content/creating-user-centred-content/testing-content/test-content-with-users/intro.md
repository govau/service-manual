Testing content is a part of usability testing and involves:

- observing users using your content (on site or remotely)
- recording your observations
- identifying problems and areas where it could be improved

At a minimum, usability testing needs a small sample size of real, representative users to identify issues. Our recommended sample size is 4 to 8 people per round of research.

Each round should answer specific research questions with specific user groups. This should happen [throughout the design process](/user-research/research-stages/).

We recommend doing a series of small studies instead of investing in one large-scale survey.

Understanding and including diverse users should be an ongoing consideration in your testing.

Make sure all your users can access information in your web service. Do this by doing accessibility checks and testing with users who have access needs.
