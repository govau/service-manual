Conduct task-based observation testing with users of your service. In this type of testing users complete typical tasks while observers take notes.

You can test usability of your content designs using prototypes. Prototypes can include:

- low-fidelity paper samples of content
- higher fidelity mock-ups for screen-based testing

## [2]Cognitive load testing
Cognitive load testing measures the mental effort needed to understand your website. One simple but effective way you can measure cognitive load is with a [tapping test](https://medium.com/@tsharon/measuring-cognitive-load-with-a-tapping-test-f07065854e46).

## [2]Eye tracking
[Eye tracking](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/eye-tracking.html) records the eyeâ€™s motion as a user views your content. It can test if they are able to find information easily in your web service.

## [2]A/B testing
A/B testing involves showing 2 versions of your content to users to see which performs better.

For example, you might want to test online content that is part of an application process. You can do scenario-based testing and show half your testing participants design A (the existing content). Show design B (new content) to the other half.

Compare each group of participants. See which has higher rates of successful completion of the process. You should assess:

- if they submitted the application
- how long they took
- how easy they rated the process
- any wrong clicks they made during the process
