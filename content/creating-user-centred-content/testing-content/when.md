Test your content from the Alpha stage through to the Live stage:

- during [Alpha](/user-research/research-stages/#user-research-in-alpha-stage), test your content designs with users
- during [Beta](/user-research/research-stages/#user-research-in-beta-stage), continue to test your content to refine it for launch
- when you move your content to [Live](/user-research/research-stages/#researching-when-your-service-is-live), keep testing to make sure itâ€™s still meeting user needs

If you are redesigning existing services or content, test existing content to help create a baseline.
